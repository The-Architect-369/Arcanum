# Tempus Reward System — Calendar & Rewards (Draft v1)

This file summarizes the **Solar (Zodiac)**, **Lunar (Phases)**, and **Planetary (Invocations)** layers,
their annual **MANA** math, **asset totals**, and a **timeline** that aligns 12 months, 8 phases per month,
and the 45‑week planetary unlock cycle. A draft diagram is included below.

> Legend: Outer wedge = 12 Zodiac (Lore + Item). Inner short ticks = 8 lunar reflections per sign (emotes/visuals).
> Spiral = 45 planetary weeks; bold ticks every 5 weeks (R1..R9) indicate a planetary reward milestone.
> Quadrant labels show elemental seasons (progress-only orbs).

## Annual Totals

| Layer      | Rewards / Sign | Signs | Total Rewards | Notes |
|------------|-----------------|-------|---------------|-------|
| **Solar**  | 1 item + lore   | 12    | **12**        | 6 tasks per sign gate the lore + item |
| **Lunar**  | 8 reflections → 5 emotes + background + banner + aura | 12 | **96** | 8 reflection tasks per sign |
| **Planetary** | 9 assets per planet (5 emotes, item, aura, background, symbol) | 7 planets | **63** | Earned via timed invocations, every 5 grants 1 asset |
| **Grand Total** | — | — | **171** | — |

## Annual MANA (Perfect Play)

- **Planetary Layer:** 600 / month × 12 = **7,200**
- **Solar Layer:** (6×10 + 100) × 12 = **1,920**
- **Lunar Layer:** (8×10 + 100) × 12 = **2,160**

**Grand Total:** **11,280 MANA / year**

## Monthly View (per Zodiac Month)

| Month (Zodiac) | Solar MANA | Lunar MANA | Planetary MANA* | Total (month) | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Aries        | 160 | 180 | 600 | **940** | Solar item + lore; 8 lunar reflections |
| Taurus       | 160 | 180 | 600 | **940** | — |
| Gemini       | 160 | 180 | 600 | **940** | — |
| Cancer       | 160 | 180 | 600 | **940** | — |
| Leo          | 160 | 180 | 600 | **940** | — |
| Virgo        | 160 | 180 | 600 | **940** | — |
| Libra        | 160 | 180 | 600 | **940** | — |
| Scorpio      | 160 | 180 | 600 | **940** | — |
| Sagittarius  | 160 | 180 | 600 | **940** | Planetary Reward R9 milestone completes 63-item set |
| Capricorn    | 160 | 180 | 600 | **940** | Overflow planetary invocations = extra MANA only |
| Aquarius     | 160 | 180 | 600 | **940** | — |
| Pisces       | 160 | 180 | 600 | **940** | — |

\*Planetary MANA is realized via daily properly timed invocations; every 5 invocations also yields 1 planetary asset (random, no duplicates).

## Planetary Unlock Timeline (45 Weeks)

| Weeks | Milestone | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1–5   | **R1** | Planetary asset #1 unlocked |
| 6–10  | **R2** | Planetary asset #2 unlocked |
| 11–15 | **R3** | Planetary asset #3 unlocked |
| 16–20 | **R4** | Planetary asset #4 unlocked |
| 21–25 | **R5** | Planetary asset #5 unlocked |
| 26–30 | **R6** | Planetary asset #6 unlocked |
| 31–35 | **R7** | Planetary asset #7 unlocked |
| 36–40 | **R8** | Planetary asset #8 unlocked |
| 41–45 | **R9** | Planetary asset #9 unlocked — full 63 planetary rewards complete |

> **Mapping to zodiac months (suggested):** R1..R9 align roughly Aries → Sagittarius.
> Capricorn → Pisces become bonus months for additional MANA once the planetary set is complete.

## Seasonal Element Orbs (Progress‑Only)

- 4 elemental quadrants overlay the year; each holds **3 zodiac signs**.
- **No MANA, no tasks.** These are **progress & lore indicators.**
- Orb brightness = % of tasks completed in that season.
- Additional elemental lore unlocks as progress increases.

| Season (Element) | Signs | Seasonal Task Count (max) | Progress Metric |
|---|---|---:|---|
| Spring (Air)   | Aries, Taurus, Gemini      | 3 × (6 solar + 8 lunar) = **42** | Completed / 42 |
| Summer (Fire)  | Cancer, Leo, Virgo         | **42** | Completed / 42 |
| Autumn (Water) | Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius| **42** | Completed / 42 |
| Winter (Earth) | Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces| **42** | Completed / 42 |

## Unlock Rules (Concise)

- **Solar:** 6 constellation tasks → +160 MANA & (Lore + Item).  
- **Lunar:** 8 reflections → +180 MANA & (5 Emotes + Background + Banner + Aura).  
- **Planetary:** Properly timed invocation → +20 MANA (double). Every 5 invocations → 1 random planetary asset (no duplicates).  
- **Catch‑Up:** Past‑year zodiac items may be purchased (e.g., **100 MANA** each) **after** the current year’s set is completed for that sign; never pay‑to‑win.
