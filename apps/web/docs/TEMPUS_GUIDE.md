_Date:_ 2025-10-02  
_Status:_ Merged RC (3 tabs + Rewards + Deferred Features)

## 0) Purpose
Tempus is the timekeeping, cosmological, and ritual engine of the Arcanum.

---
## 1) Sub-pages (Left→Center→Right)
- **Codex** | **Clock** | **Calendar**
- **Default on enter:** **Clock**
- **Pips & gestures:** per Core UI Guide

---
## 2) Functional Spec
### 2.1 Codex (ACC-gated)
- Reference of Planets, Zodiac, Phases, Elements.  
- Searchable with tags.  
- ACC required to save/favorite.

### 2.2 Clock (default)
- Sigil clock readout + Sol/Terra time.  
- Pure view, no gating.

### 2.3 Calendar
- Month/day views, events list.  
- ACC required to interact/earn.  
- MANA required to create events.

---
## 3) Rewards & Progression (Integrated)
- **Solar:** 12 rewards (Lore + Item)  
- **Lunar:** 96 rewards (Reflections → emotes, backgrounds, auras)  
- **Planetary:** 63 assets via 45-week cycle  
- **Grand Total:** 171 assets; 11,280 MANA/year (perfect play)

### Monthly Example
- Aries: 160 Solar + 180 Lunar + 600 Planetary = 940 MANA

### Seasonal Orbs
