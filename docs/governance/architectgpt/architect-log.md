# ArchitectGPT Log

This file is the active append-only log for ArchitectGPT development sessions.

The canonical ArchitectGPT interface remains:

- `docs/governance/architectgpt/architect-gpt.md`
- `docs/governance/architectgpt/architect-gpt-manifest.yaml`

Legacy logs and superseded ArchitectGPT materials are stored under:

- `docs/archive/architectgpt/`

## Log protocol

Each session entry should include:

- date
- branch / commit when known
- repository grounding state
- files changed or reviewed
- doctrinal impact
- verification commands and results
- follow-up actions

## 2026-05-26 — Structural Alignment Audit Pass

Grounding:

- branch: `mobile`
- purpose: archive dated app docs, split ArchitectGPT logs from canonical spec, and introduce current app specs
- verification state before patch:
  - app typecheck: green
  - app build: green
  - verify-sync: failing because repo index differs from generator output

Actions initiated:

- identified dated app-local docs for archive
- established `docs/specs/app/` as current implementation-facing app spec surface
- established active ArchitectGPT log outside the canonical interface spec
- prepared archive structure for app and ArchitectGPT historical materials
