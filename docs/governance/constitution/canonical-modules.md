# Canonical Modules

CANONICAL MODULES OF ARCANUM
---
role: constitution
authority: absolute
scope: system-wide
version: 1.0
status: ratified
---

Preamble

This document defines the canonical modules of the Arcanum system.

A canonical module is a first-class subsystem whose existence, authority, and boundaries are explicitly recognized by the Arcanum Constitution. No module may be created, removed, or substantially altered without alignment to this canon.

If a capability, feature, or behavior is not attributable to a canonical module, it is not permitted to exist within Arcanum.

Canonical Authority Model

Every module is governed by three questions:

Where does it live?
(Doctrine · Chain · App · Experience)

What is its source of truth?
(Constitution · Chain State · App State · Lived State)

What may it depend on — and what may not depend on it?

Violations of these rules constitute doctrinal drift.

MODULE I — ARCHITECT (Doctrine & Governance)

Status: Canonical
Layer: Doctrine
Source of Truth: Constitution (docs/00_CONSTITUTION)

Purpose

The Architect module governs system self-awareness, doctrine integrity, and change discipline.

It exists to ensure that Arcanum remains coherent across time, code, and narrative.

Responsibilities

Define constitutional law

Declare canonical modules

Enforce source-of-truth boundaries

Maintain doctrinal logs and synchronization

Dependencies

None

Forbidden

The Architect may not depend on app logic, chain state, or user data.

No other module may override or bypass Architect doctrine.

MODULE II — HOPE (Reflection & Inner Dialogue)

Status: Canonical
Layer: App / Experience
Source of Truth: Lived State + App Logic

Purpose

Hope governs inner dialogue, reflection, and meaning-making.

It represents the personal, introspective interface between a being and the system.

Responsibilities

Conversational reflection

Contextual guidance

Meaning synthesis

Dependencies

Identity (for context)

Vitae (for progression awareness)

Tempus (for timing context)

Forbidden

Hope may not enforce progression

Hope may not write to chain state

Hope may not alter economic balances

MODULE III — TEMPUS (Time & Rhythm)

Status: Canonical
Layer: App + Chain (Anchors)
Source of Truth: Chain Anchors + App Schedulers

Purpose

Tempus governs time, rhythm, cycles, and temporal structure.

It ensures that Arcanum unfolds according to rhythm rather than urgency.

Responsibilities

Epochs and cycles

Ritual timing

Temporal constraints on actions

Dependencies

Chain (for anchoring)

Architect (for temporal doctrine)

Forbidden

Tempus may not define meaning

Tempus may not allocate value

Tempus may not advance Vitae directly

MODULE IV — VITAE (Becoming & Progression)

Status: Canonical
Layer: Experience / App / (Optional Chain Anchors)
Source of Truth: Lived State + Constitutional Invariants

Purpose

Vitae governs growth, maturation, and becoming.

It is a sovereign progression system that recognizes readiness, mastery, and responsibility as states that emerge over time.

Responsibilities

Define progression states

Enforce grade invariants

Govern specialization and mastery

Maintain experiential integrity

Dependencies

Tempus (for temporal gating)

Identity (for subject continuity)

Forbidden

Vitae may not mint or transfer value

Vitae may not be reduced to scoring

Vitae progression may not be bypassed by payment or authority

Chain Interaction

Vitae progression is lived off-chain

Proofs of state, thresholds, or mastery may be anchored on-chain

The chain may witness Vitae, but never define it

MODULE V — IDENTITY (Continuity & Sovereignty)

Status: Canonical
Layer: App / Protocol
Source of Truth: Identity Records + User Control

Purpose

Identity governs who a being is across time, context, and interaction.

Responsibilities

Persistent identity

Relationship binding

Context continuity

Dependencies

None (foundational)

Forbidden

Identity may not be owned by the app

Identity may not be traded

Identity may not be fragmented without consent

MODULE VI — ECONOMY (Circulation & Value)

Status: Canonical
Layer: Chain
Source of Truth: Arcanum Chain

Purpose

The Economy module governs value circulation without speculation.

Responsibilities

Define economic invariants

Govern MANA utility

Enforce sinks and flows

Dependencies

Treasury

Chain State

Forbidden

Economy may not create speculative instruments

Economy may not override chain invariants

Economy may not be governed by app logic

MODULE VII — TREASURY (Custody & Stewardship)

Status: Canonical
Layer: Chain
Source of Truth: Arcanum Chain

Purpose

The Treasury governs collective custody and long-term stewardship.

Responsibilities

Hold protocol assets

Enforce distribution rules

Protect against capture

Dependencies

Chain governance

Forbidden

Treasury may not be controlled by a single actor

Treasury may not be accessed directly by the app

Treasury rules may not be silently changed

MODULE VIII — ARCANUM CHAIN (Protocol Integrity)

Status: Canonical
Layer: Protocol
Source of Truth: Chain State

Purpose

The Arcanum Chain enforces non-negotiable truth.

Responsibilities

Enforce economic rules

Anchor time

Protect treasury

Maintain protocol invariants

Dependencies

Architect doctrine

Forbidden

The chain may not govern meaning

The chain may not define personal growth

The chain may not be bypassed for protocol truth

MODULE IX — NEXUS (Social Fabric)

Status: Canonical
Layer: App / Experience
Source of Truth: Lived Interaction

Purpose

Nexus governs connection, discourse, and shared presence.

Responsibilities

Social interaction

Shared spaces

Collective experience

Dependencies

Identity

Hope (contextual)

Forbidden

Nexus may not enforce doctrine

Nexus may not allocate economic value

Nexus may not alter progression

MODULE X — WALLET (Interface, Not Authority)

Status: Canonical
Layer: App
Source of Truth: Chain

Purpose

The Wallet provides visibility and interaction with on-chain state.

Responsibilities

Display balances

Initiate permitted transactions

Dependencies

Arcanum Chain

Forbidden

Wallet may not define balances

Wallet may not hold custody

Wallet may not bypass treasury rules

Dependency Invariants (Global)

The following are system-wide invariants:

App modules may read chain state but may not define it

Chain modules may enforce rules but may not define meaning

Experience modules may shape becoming but may not mint value

Doctrine supersedes all other layers

Any violation constitutes a constitutional breach.

Amendment Protocol

This document may only be amended by:

Explicit constitutional change

Full doctrine review

Synchronized update across:

Architect canon

Chain specs

App alignment docs

Silent drift is forbidden.

Closing Declaration

Arcanum is not a product.
It is a coherent system of becoming.

This canon exists so that coherence may endure.
