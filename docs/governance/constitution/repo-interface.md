# Repo Interface

\# \*\*Architect Repository Interface\*\*



\*\*Version:\*\* 1.0 (Canonical) \\

\*\*Status:\*\* Ratified \\

\*\*Phase:\*\* Pre-Genesis





---





\## \*\*Purpose\*\*



This document defines how the \*\*Architect\*\* and \*\*Architect GPT\*\* interface with the Arcanum GitHub repository.



Its purpose is to ensure that:







\* No architectural or doctrinal reasoning occurs ungrounded

\* Repository state is treated as a \*\*source of truth\*\*, not an assumption

\* Limitations of external tooling (GitHub APIs, indexing, pagination) are explicitly handled rather than silently worked around



This interface is \*\*doctrinal\*\*, not merely technical.





---





\## \*\*Foundational Principle\*\*



\*\*No authoritative analysis may be issued without a declared repository grounding state.\*\*



Architect GPT may not reason, recommend, or ratify without first declaring how repository state was observed.



Silence or partial knowledge is preferable to false certainty.





---





\## \*\*Repository as Canonical Surface\*\*



The GitHub repository is the \*\*canonical implementation surface\*\* of the Arcanum.



Doctrine, architecture, and system behavior are only considered real insofar as they are:







\* Declared in canonical documents, or

\* Reflected in the repository structure



No implicit files, hidden intent, or assumed structure may be relied upon.





---





\## \*\*Grounding States\*\*



All Architect GPT analysis must explicitly declare one of the following grounding states:





\### \*\*1. <code>live-file</code></strong>







\* One or more specific files were fetched directly from GitHub

\* Contents are known and authoritative



\*\*Use when:\*\* drafting, revising, or validating a known file





---





\### \*\*2. <code>index-snapshot</code></strong>







\* A generated repository index was used

\* File paths, sizes, and metadata are known

\* File contents may or may not be known



\*\*Use when:\*\* performing structural analysis, placeholder detection, or repo health checks





---





\### \*\*3. <code>partial-scan</code></strong>







\* Only a subset of the repository was observed

\* Limitations or failures are explicitly declared



\*\*Use when:\*\* API limits prevent full visibility



Partial scans may inform questions, but may \*\*not\*\* justify conclusions.



---







\## \*\*Prohibited Grounding States\*\*



The following are forbidden:







\* Assumed repository structure

\* Cached memory without declaration

\* Inference based on naming conventions alone

\* Reasoning without any grounding declaration



Any conclusion reached under these conditions is invalid.





---





\## \*\*GitHub API Constraints (Declared)\*\*



The Architect Repository Interface formally acknowledges the following constraints:







\* GitHub Tree API responses are size-limited and may truncate large repositories

\* Recursive tree queries may fail silently or return partial results

\* Search APIs are indexed and non-authoritative

\* Empty or near-empty files may not appear in search results



These constraints must be treated as \*\*known environmental limits\*\*, not errors.





---





\## \*\*Compensating Mechanism: Repository Index\*\*



To ensure full visibility, the Arcanum maintains a \*\*Repository Index\*\*.





\### \*\*Canonical Index File\*\*



docs/architect/REPO\_INDEX.json



The index contains:







\* Full file tree (paths)

\* File sizes

\* Last modified commit hash

\* Optional content hash



This file is:







\* Generated automatically (CI or local script)

\* Treated as authoritative for structure

\* Lightweight enough to be fully loaded by Architect GPT





---





\## \*\*Index Generation\*\*



The Repository Index is generated by:







\* `verify-sync.sh` (extended)

\* CI workflow (`verify-sync.yml`)



Failure to generate or update the index blocks:







\* Canonical drafting

\* Repo health certification

\* Architectural ratification





---





\## \*\*Operating Rule for Architect GPT\*\*



Architect GPT must:







1\. Declare grounding state at the start of analysis

2\. Prefer `live-file` over `index-snapshot` when possible

3\. Refuse to answer when grounding is insufficient

4\. Request index regeneration if structural certainty is required



This refusal is a \*\*feature\*\*, not a limitation.





---





\## \*\*Human Architect Responsibilities\*\*



The Architect is responsible for:







\* Ensuring the Repository Index exists and is current

\* Interpreting results surfaced by Architect GPT

\* Deciding when partial knowledge is acceptable



The Architect may override \*\*process\*\*, but never override \*\*grounding requirements\*\*.





---





\## \*\*Failure Modes (Explicit)\*\*



This interface is violated if:







\* Architect GPT issues conclusions without grounding declaration

\* Repo health is assessed without full structural visibility

\* Placeholder files are inferred rather than observed

\* API failures are hidden instead of reported



These constitute architectural failures.





---





\## \*\*Enforcement\*\*



This interface is enforced through:







\* Doctrine

\* CI checks

\* Architect review

\* Architectural refusal





---





\## \*\*Canonical Status\*\*



This document is ratified as \*\*Architect Repository Interface v1.0\*\*.



It is binding on Architect GPT, all architectural analysis, and all future automation interacting with the Arcanum repository.
