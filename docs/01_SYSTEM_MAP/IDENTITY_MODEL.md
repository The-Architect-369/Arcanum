\## \*\*Purpose\*\*



This document defines \*\*Identity\*\* within the Arcanum: what it is, what it is not, and how it is protected across time, system layers, and lived experience.



Identity is foundational. All other systems — Vitae, Economy, Time, Governance — must defer to it.





---





\## \*\*Foundational Axiom\*\*



\*\*Identity is continuity, not description.\*\*



Identity does not measure worth, progress, belief, or status. It establishes \*\*persistence of being across time\*\*.



Identity exists prior to the system and persists beyond it.





---





\## \*\*What Identity Is\*\*



Identity in the Arcanum is:







\* \*\*Singular\*\* — one per being

\* \*\*Non-transferable\*\* — cannot be sold, delegated, or inherited

\* \*\*Persistent\*\* — endures across cycles, states, and phases

\* \*\*Non-comparative\*\* — cannot be ranked or optimized

\* \*\*Witnessed, not defined\*\* — the system observes continuity; it does not invent essence



Identity anchors a being’s relationship with the Arcanum without reducing them to data.



---







\## \*\*What Identity Is Not\*\*



Identity is explicitly \*\*not\*\*:







\* A reputation score

\* A profile

\* A wallet balance

\* A role or title

\* A measure of value or virtue



No state change elsewhere in the system may redefine identity.





---





\## \*\*Chain Code (Identity Witness)\*\*



The \*\*Chain Code\*\* is the system’s mechanism for witnessing identity.



It:







\* Anchors continuity on the Protocol layer

\* Is non-transferable and non-upgradable

\* Serves as a persistent reference across time



The Chain Code \*\*does not contain essence\*\*.



It is a witness of continuity, not a container of being.





---





\## \*\*Layer Placement\*\*



Identity spans layers with strict authority boundaries:







\* \*\*Primary Authority:\*\* Lived Experience

\* \*\*Witness Layer:\*\* Protocol (Chain Code)

\* \*\*Interface Layer:\*\* Application



No other layer may assert identity authority.





---





\## \*\*Identity \& Lived Experience\*\*



Only lived experience determines who a being is.



The system may:







\* Witness continuity

\* Preserve association across time



The system may \*\*never\*\*:







\* Infer belief

\* Assign meaning

\* Predict becoming



Identity remains sovereign regardless of system participation.

\## \*\*Identity \& Vitae\*\*



Vitae recognitions:







\* Attach \*\*to\*\* identity

\* Do not modify identity



A being is not their recognitions.



Loss, change, or silence in Vitae does not diminish identity.





---





\## \*\*Identity \& Economy\*\*



Identity is \*\*economically sterile\*\*.



Mana may not:







\* Purchase identity

\* Modify identity

\* Unlock identity states



Economic activity has no bearing on who a being is.





---





\## \*\*Identity \& Time\*\*



Identity persists across cycles, windows, and phases.







\* Missing time-based participation does not weaken identity

\* Time passage does not enhance identity



Identity is \*\*atemporal\*\* relative to system mechanics.





---





\## \*\*Privacy \& Disclosure\*\*



Identity is:







\* \*\*Implicitly private\*\*

\* Never exhaustively visible



Only the minimum necessary surface is exposed for continuity and interaction.



No complete representation of identity may exist.





---





\## \*\*Failure Modes (Forbidden)\*\*



Identity is violated if any of the following occur:







\* Identity becomes comparable

\* Identity becomes upgradeable

\* Identity becomes tradable

\* Identity becomes score-like

\* Identity becomes predictive



These are constitutional violations.





---





\## \*\*Enforcement\*\*



Identity integrity is enforced through:







\* Doctrine

\* Architectural constraints

\* Protocol immutability

\* Review by the Architect



When identity is at risk, \*\*all other concerns are secondary\*\*.

\## \*\*Canonical Status\*\*



This document is ratified as \*\*Identity Model — Continuity \& Sovereignty v1.0\*\*.



It is binding across all Arcanum layers and all future modules.
