Experience **emotion as bodily presence** without movement, reaction, or expression.

---

### **2\. Primary Anatomical Focus**

* Autonomic nervous system  
* Breath–heart rhythm  
* Somatic sensation

---

### **3\. Canonical Truths**

* Emotion lives in the body.  
* Stillness allows sensation to settle.  
* Presence regulates intensity.

---

### **4\. Required Conceptual Moves**

* Stillness or grounded posture

---

### **6\. Prohibited Framing**

* “Release” narratives

---

### **7\. Completion Condition**

The practitioner remains present through the full embodiment period.

---

## **WATER KERNEL — Reflection on Emotional Sensation**

Integrate awareness of emotional sensation through reflection.

---

### **2\. Reflection Medium**

* Voice → text transcription  
* Stored for longitudinal reference

---
