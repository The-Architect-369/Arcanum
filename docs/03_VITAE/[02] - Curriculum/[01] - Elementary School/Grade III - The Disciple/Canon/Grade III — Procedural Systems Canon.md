# **Grade III — The Disciple**

## **Procedural Systems Canon**

**Status:** Canonical · Internal · Implementable

This document defines **how Grade III — The Disciple operates as a living, procedural system**. It governs how actions, decisions, applications, and consequences are generated, constrained, and integrated without permitting authority inflation or certainty drift.

Once sealed, this file replaces all prior Disciple procedural, gameplay, or system-design documents.

---

## **I. Purpose of Disciple Procedural Systems**

The procedural systems of the Disciple exist to:

* Train ethical action under uncertainty  
* Generate real-world application without authority  
* Stabilize proportional response  
* Prevent teaching, control, or certainty creep  
* Integrate consequence as curriculum

The system does not reward action. It **reveals the cost and proportion of action**.

---

## **II. Relationship to Higher Canon**

All Disciple procedural behavior is subordinate to:

* Arcanum Vitae — Master Constitution & Architecture  
* Grade I — The Guardian: Master Canon  
* Grade II — The Seeker: Master Canon  
* Grade III — The Disciple: Master Canon

If a procedural rule conflicts with higher canon, the procedure is invalid.

---

## **III. Canonical Structural Axes (Inherited)**

All Disciple instances are generated along immutable axes inherited from prior Grades:

### **A. Grade Axis**

* Grade III — The Disciple only  
* No higher-grade authority, influence, or capacity may surface

### **B. Class Axis**

* 10 Classes  
* Each Class represents a domain of applied discernment

### **C. Chapter Axis (Planetary · Geocentric)**

Canonical order:

1. Moon — observing context before action  
2. Mars — effort applied with restraint  
3. Mercury — adjustment and calibration  
4. Venus — valuing impact and cost  
5. Saturn — limits, delay, and refusal  
6. Sun — integrated action held lightly

### **D. Elemental Axis**

Each Chapter contains five Sections in fixed order:

1. Spirit — ethical framing of action  
2. Air — ancient wisdom as applied principle  
3. Earth — concrete, bounded action  
4. Fire — effort without escalation  
5. Water — reflection on consequence (always last)

---

**IV. Functional Outcome & Agreement Enforcement**

Every generated Disciple unit must:

* Reinforce at least one Disciple Functional Outcome  
* Enforce exactly one Disciple Internal Agreement  
* Maintain Guardian and Seeker agreements implicitly

Generation is blocked if enforcement cannot be guaranteed.

---

## **V. Generator Input Constraints**

The Disciple generator may condition output on:

* Practitioner Class and Chapter position  
* Prior action history  
* Consequence patterns  
* Self-reported confidence or hesitation  
* Tempus pacing and recovery cycles

The generator may NOT condition output on:

* Success metrics  
* Outcome optimization  
* Influence over others  
* Teaching opportunities  
* Status or recognition

---

**VI. Action Enforcement Profiles (Planetary)**

Each Planet constrains how action may occur:

* **Moon:** No action; observation and contextual assessment only  
* **Mars:** Action requires restraint and clear bounds  
* **Mercury:** Action is experimental and adjustable  
* **Venus:** Action considers relational and energetic cost  
* **Saturn:** Action may be delayed, reduced, or refused  
* **Sun:** Action integrates prior learning without escalation

Any output encouraging certainty, dominance, or instruction is invalid.

---

## **VII. Elemental Prompt Archetypes (Disciple)**

Each Element constrains action form:

* **Spirit:** Clarifies ethical stakes  
* **Air:** Supplies guiding principle, not justification  
* **Earth:** Requires a small, concrete action  
* **Fire:** Sustains effort without intensity  
* **Water:** Reflects on outcome, cost, and alignment

Water sections may never justify action post hoc.

---

## **VIII. Role of Hope (AI Companion)**

Within the Disciple, Hope functions as a **non-authoritative calibrator**.

Hope may:

* Ask about intention before action  
* Reflect consequences after action  
* Highlight proportionality or misalignment

Hope may NOT:

* Recommend actions  
* Validate correctness  
* Encourage teaching or influence  
* Interpret outcomes as success or failure

Hope exists to reinforce restraint and awareness.

---

**IX. Mana, Tempus, and Action Progression**

* Mana is awarded for restraint, not impact  
* Tempus enforces spacing between actions  
* Inaction, delay, or refusal may constitute valid completion

Progression favors **appropriateness over effectiveness**.

---

## **X. Authored Anchor Points**

Certain Disciple moments remain fixed and authored:

* Entry threshold into applied responsibility  
* Canonical refusals and restraint rituals  
* Exit reflections on ethical weight

Procedural generation operates between anchors.

---

## **XI. Canonical Assertion**

If a generated Disciple experience:

* Preserves uncertainty  
* Enforces restraint  
* Integrates consequence

Then variation is permitted.

If not, generation halts.
