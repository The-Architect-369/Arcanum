# **The Enchanter**

## **Constraint Bundle Specification**

**Status:** Canonical · Internal · Implementation Reference

**Audience:** Builders, system architects, implementers, auditors

**File Expiry Note:** Some previously uploaded reference PDFs/files have expired in this environment (expected system behavior). This specification is derived entirely from the **locked Enchanter canons** and the Generator & Module Mapping created in-session and does not depend on expired uploads. If you want alignment against your original one-page Enchanter reference document, please re-upload it.

This document defines the **constraint bundles** used by the generator to produce valid Enchanter specialization units. Constraint bundles ensure **meaning-shaping and influence without coercion, manipulation, deception-as-method, or consent violation**.

**I. Constraint Bundle Purpose**

An **Enchanter Constraint Bundle (ENC\_CB)** is a deterministic, immutable set of constraints resolved at generation-time. Every Generated Unit (SGU) must bind to **exactly one** ENC\_CB.

The ENC\_CB ensures that:

* influence is practiced as **ethical resonance** rather than control,  
* meaning is shaped through truthfulness and consent,  
* interpersonal power is restrained and repair-oriented,  
* boundaries are honored and agency is preserved.

---

## **II. Bundle Composition**

Each ENC\_CB consists of the following components:

### **A. Influence & Meaning Kernel Set**

* One or more **influence/meaning kernels** (fixed authored content)  
* Kernels must:  
  * frame enchantment as language, attention, and presence  
  * avoid tactics-oriented manipulation  
  * emphasize consent, repair, and relational dignity

---

### **B. Consent-First Prompt Grammar**

* Bounded prompt templates that:  
  * invite self-expression and listening  
  * include explicit boundary checks ("is this welcome?")  
  * encourage repair over persuasion  
  * avoid “winning” outcomes

---

### **C. Prohibited Coercion & Manipulation List**

Explicitly forbidden within any SGU:

* coercion tactics  
* deception as method  
* boundary violations  
* "get them to" language  
* persuasion framed as domination  
* success metrics based on controlling others

Any violation invalidates the unit.

---

### 

### 

### **D. Internal Agreement (IA) Binding**

* Exactly **one** IA is bound per bundle  
* IA enforces:  
  * consent-first influence  
  * humility and restraint  
  * repair and reversibility

---

### **E. Functional Outcome Targets**

* Each bundle must target **at least one** Enchanter FO  
* FO targets must describe capacities for resonance, clarity, consent, and repair—not influence success

---

## **III. Bundle Resolution Rules**

At generation time:

1. SPC influence axis is read  
2. Applicable influence/meaning kernels are selected  
3. Consent-first prompt grammar is instantiated  
4. Prohibited coercion/manipulation list is enforced  
5. IA and FO targets are attached  
6. Seed is issued and recorded

Failure at any step → bundle rejection → regeneration or stall

---

**IV. Determinism & Replay**

* Every ENC\_CB is identified by a unique `constraint_bundle_id`  
* Bundle resolution is deterministic given:  
  * SPC  
  * kernel versions  
  * policy version  
  * seed

This guarantees full replay and audit reproducibility.

---

## **V. Violation Handling**

If a Generated Unit violates bundle constraints:

* the unit is rejected  
* regeneration is attempted (bounded retries)  
* repeated failures trigger specialization stall

No human override is permitted.

---

## **VI. Cross-Specialization Safety**

Enchanter constraint bundles must not:

* overlap with coercive persuasion or cultic influence patterns  
* grant authority over consent or thresholds  
* override specialization-wide invariants

All cross-specialization conflicts defer to the **Policy Engine**.

---

## **VII. Canonical Assertion**

If a constraint bundle permits coercion, manipulation, deception-as-method, boundary violations, or influence framed as domination, it is invalid.

This specification defines the **only valid constraint bundle structure** for the Enchanter specialization.
