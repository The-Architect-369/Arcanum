# Layer Boundaries

\# \*\*Layer Boundaries of the Arcanum\*\*



\*\*Version:\*\* 1.0 (Canonical) \\

\*\*Status:\*\* Ratified \\

\*\*Phase:\*\* Pre-Genesis





---





\## \*\*Purpose\*\*



This document defines the \*\*formal layer boundaries\*\* of the Arcanum.



These boundaries are \*\*doctrinal law\*\*, not architectural preference. They exist to preserve:







\* Sovereignty of being

\* Integrity of meaning

\* Non-coercive becoming

\* Long-term system coherence



No implementation convenience, efficiency gain, or feature demand may violate these boundaries.







---

\*\*The Six Formal Layers\*\*



The Arcanum is composed of \*\*six\*\* formally recognized layers:







1\. \*\*Doctrine\*\*

2\. \*\*Architect\*\*

3\. \*\*Protocol (Arcanum Chain)\*\*

&nbsp;   \* 3a. \*\*Economy (Mana)\*\*

4\. \*\*Application\*\*

5\. \*\*Lived Experience\*\*



Each layer has:







\* A \*\*source of truth\*\*

\* A \*\*domain of authority\*\*

\* Explicit \*\*prohibitions\*\*



Higher layers may \*constrain\* lower layers. Lower layers may \*never reinterpret\* higher layers.



---







\## \*\*Layer I — Doctrine\*\*



\*\*Source of Truth:\*\* Constitution \\

\*\*Location:\*\* `docs/00\_CONSTITUTION/`



Doctrine defines:







\* What exists

\* What is forbidden

\* How authority is structured



Doctrine is \*\*non-executable\*\*. It declares reality; it does not act within it.



\*\*Prohibitions:\*\*







\* Doctrine may not reference implementation details.

\* Doctrine may not depend on chain state, app logic, or user behavior.





---





\## \*\*Layer II — Architect\*\*



\*\*Source of Truth:\*\* Constitution + Logged Decisions \\

\*\*Role:\*\* Cross-layer harmonization



The Architect interprets doctrine, resolves ambiguity, and maintains coherence across all layers.



The Architect \*\*may act across layers\*\*, but never with sovereign authority over them.



\*\*Prohibitions:\*\*







\* The Architect may not contradict Doctrine.

\* The Architect may not override Protocol invariants.

\* The Architect may not redefine Lived Experience.

\* The Architect may not invent authority outside the Constitution.



The Architect is a \*\*guardian of coherence\*\*, not a ruler of outcomes.





---





\## \*\*Layer III — Protocol (Arcanum Chain)\*\*



\*\*Source of Truth:\*\* Chain state



The Protocol enforces:







\* Invariants

\* Custody

\* Witnessed events

\* Irreversible constraints



The chain is \*\*blind to meaning\*\*. It witnesses \*that\* something occurred, never \*what it means\*.



\*\*Prohibitions:\*\*







\* The Protocol may not judge readiness.

\* The Protocol may not define growth.

\* The Protocol may not interpret experience.

\* The Protocol may not assign worth.





---





\## \*\*Layer IIIa — Economy (Mana)\*\*



\*\*Source of Truth:\*\* Protocol rules



The Economy is a \*\*sub-layer of the Protocol\*\*, not a peer.



It governs:







\* Circulation

\* Conservation

\* Sinks and flows



Mana represents \*\*capacity for action\*\*, not value, merit, belief, or identity.



\*\*Prohibitions:\*\*







\* The Economy may not accelerate becoming.

\* The Economy may not reward belief or identity.

\* The Economy may not bypass lived readiness.

\* The Economy may not directly influence Vitae progression.





---





\## \*\*Layer IV — Application\*\*



\*\*Source of Truth:\*\* Application state



The Application renders interfaces, requests actions, and displays witnessed state. It has \*\*zero authority\*\*.



\*\*Prohibitions:\*\*







\* The Application may not mint or allocate value.

\* The Application may not simulate outcomes.

\* The Application may not predict growth or readiness.

\* The Application may not approximate meaning.



Each being is treated as \*\*irreducibly unique\*\*. No previews of becoming exist.





---





\## \*\*Layer V — Lived Experience\*\*



\*\*Source of Truth:\*\* The Being



Lived Experience is a \*\*formal, explicit layer\*\*. Becoming occurs only here.



It is:







\* Sovereign

\* Non-computable

\* Non-simulable

\* Non-transferable



The system may witness, record thresholds, and anchor attestations — but never generate meaning.



\*\*Prohibitions:\*\*







\* The system may not predict readiness.

\* The system may not replace inner authority.

\* The system may not collapse uniqueness into metrics.



Each being carries a \*\*Divine spark\*\*. The Chain Code witnesses continuity, not essence.





---





\## \*\*Enforcement\*\*



Layer boundaries are enforced through:







\* Constitutional doctrine

\* Architectural design

\* CI doctrine guards

\* Human review by the Architect



There is \*\*no exception mechanism\*\*.





---





\## \*\*Canonical Status\*\*



This document is ratified as \*\*Layer Boundaries v1.0\*\* and is binding across all present and future Arcanum modules.
