# Roadmap
**Sovereign Genesis → Living World (Canonical)**

This roadmap describes the **emergence of a layered system**, not a date-driven rollout.
Arcanum advances phases only when **readiness and integrity** are true.

> Presence before mechanics · Rhythm before scale · Meaning before value

---

## 0) How to read this roadmap

Each phase includes:

- **Objective** — the question the phase must answer
- **Scope** — what is allowed to exist in that phase
- **Deliverables** — artifacts that must ship
- **Guardrails** — forbidden moves (anti-coercion / anti-extraction)
- **Exit criteria** — the system proves stability and can safely gain the next layer
- **Doctrine gates** — required checks before phase advancement

This file is the *single* roadmap. Other roadmap drafts should be treated as legacy references.

---

## 1) Global constraints (non-negotiable across all phases)

These apply to every phase:

- ❌ No economy (Mana) mechanics before **Identity + Chain MVP**
- ❌ No Vitae recognition before **post-Genesis stabilization**
- ❌ No acceleration of time-based progression via payment
- ❌ No reputation scores, leaderboards, engagement-optimized feeds, or virality mechanics
- ✅ Silence is valid: low activity or pause is an acceptable outcome
- ✅ Every phase must pass:
  - **Doctrine Guard**
  - **Repo index integrity** (structure, canonical paths, references)
  - **Layer boundaries** (no cross-layer contamination)

---

## 2) Robustness requirements (the “data points” every phase must satisfy)

Every phase must explicitly answer these robustness requirements before advancing:

### 2.1 Layer boundaries (no contamination)
- Site/App behavior must not smuggle in chain semantics.
- Chain must not encode meaning, worth, or progress.
- Curriculum and Vitae must not become coercion tools.

### 2.2 Dignity invariants
- No worth scoring.
- No forced participation.
- Opt-out is real (including reset paths where applicable).
- No pressure loops (streaks, deadlines, “fear of loss” mechanics).

### 2.3 Observability without surveillance
- Collect only what is needed for reliability and safety.
- Avoid personal dossiers; prefer aggregate and event-level truth.
- “Proof” must never become “profiling.”

### 2.4 Replaceability and rollback
- Early layers must remain replaceable (especially Chain MVP).
- Upgrades must be reversible until stabilization thresholds are met.

### 2.5 Security and custody
- Wallet custody is user-first.
- Treasury cannot be single-actor discretionary power.
- Contracts must be minimal and auditable.

### 2.6 Economic posture (permission-first)
- Free participation must remain viable.
- Purchased capacity must not become authority or time acceleration.
- Scarcity should emerge from commitment and rhythm, not price.

---

## 3) Phase map (Genesis spine)

### Phase G0 — Genesis Zero (Sealed Architecture)
**Objective:** Can the system be grounded without drift?

**Scope:** Doctrine + repo discipline only.

**Delivered:**
- Constitution sealed (checksums verified)
- Repository grounding enforced
- Repo index live
- Architect authority constrained and auditable

**Exit criteria:**
- Architectural seal + sync verification complete

---

### Phase G1 — Presence & Reflection (HOPE MVP)
**Objective:** Can humans arrive voluntarily without pressure loops?

**Scope:**
- HOPE only
- No permanent identity
- No metrics beyond basic reliability observability

**Deliverables:**
- Simple surface (web/app):
  - create reflection / post
  - read / witness others
- No likes, ranks, rewards, streaks, or engagement bait
- Anonymous/ephemeral presence allowed

**Guardrails:**
- No growth mechanics
- No economy hooks
- No feed optimized for attention capture

**Exit criteria:**
- Humans use it voluntarily
- No emergent pressure loops
- Qualitative feedback shows “less rushed, more grounded”

---

### Phase G2 — Rhythm & Time (TEMPUS MVP)
**Objective:** Can time be felt as structure without becoming productivity coercion?

**Scope:**
- TEMPUS only (still no economy, still no permanent identity)

**Deliverables:**
- “Windows” (open / closed / silent)
- Cycles/seasons as soft cues
- Optional participation markers (no penalties)

**Guardrails:**
- No deadlines
- No streaks
- No punishment mechanics

**Exit criteria:**
- Users report time enhances meaning (not urgency)
- Rhythm reduces chaos without increasing pressure

---

### Phase G3 — Identity (Genesis-Light Continuity)
**Objective:** Can continuity exist without status?

**Scope:**
- Stable pseudonymous identity
- No soul-bound permanence yet
- No reputation, no scores

**Deliverables:**
- Return-as-same-presence identity
- Clear opt-out and reset paths
- Identity is economically sterile

**Guardrails:**
- No binding to privilege
- No irreversible commitments

**Exit criteria:**
- Identity feels grounding, not trapping
- No incentive to hoard identity or game it

---

### Phase G4 — Social Fabric (NEXUS Seed)
**Objective:** Can connection emerge without engineered domination?

**Scope:**
- Minimal Nexus primitives layered over Hope + Identity

**Deliverables:**
- Follow/circle/witness mechanics
- Small group formation tools
- No algorithmic amplification

**Guardrails:**
- No virality
- No public rankings
- No engagement-optimized feeds

**Exit criteria:**
- Healthy micro-communities form
- No dominance or attention-capture patterns

---

### Phase G5 — Arcanum Chain MVP (Meaning-blind Truth)
**Objective:** Can mechanical truth exist without encoding meaning?

**Scope:**
- Chain MVP (or L2)
- Identity anchoring events only
- No economy yet

**Deliverables:**
- Minimal deployment
- Anchor identity events
- Emit non-semantic receipts (“facts only”)

**Guardrails:**
- Chain must not encode progress, worth, or meaning
- Chain must be replaceable at this stage

**Exit criteria:**
- Technical reliability
- No semantic leakage into chain logic
- Event model is sufficient for reconstruction

---

### Phase G6 — Economy (Mana as Capacity Only)
**Objective:** Can capacity exist without turning into reward/extraction?

**Scope:**
- Economy module (restricted)
- Treasury inactive or test-only

**Deliverables:**
- Mana as access / rate-limit relief
- Clear sinks tied to utility (not “status”)
- No profit narrative in UX

**Guardrails:**
- Mana cannot accelerate time
- Mana cannot bypass Vitae
- Mana cannot grant status

**Exit criteria:**
- Economy feels optional and “invisible”
- No extractive behaviors emerge
- Free-to-participate remains viable

---

### Phase G7 — Treasury Activation (Stewardship)
**Objective:** Can collective custody exist without power concentration?

**Scope:**
- Treasury module activation
- Multisig + transparent policy constraints

**Deliverables:**
- Multisig setup
- Public ledger visibility
- Explicit spending constraints and reporting cadence

**Guardrails:**
- No discretionary single-actor authority
- No opaque flows

**Exit criteria:**
- Treasury is trusted by participants
- Stewardship norms are legible and enforceable

---

### Phase G8 — Vitae (Post-Genesis Recognition)
**Objective:** Can recognition arise without pressure or hierarchy?

**Scope:**
- Vitae first activation
- Retrospective recognition only
- No irreversible grades initially

**Deliverables:**
- Threshold definitions (non-competitive)
- Recognition surfaces that preserve silence as valid
- No coupling to Mana or time acceleration

**Guardrails:**
- No forced progression
- No status ladder effects
- No economic privilege for recognition

**Exit criteria:**
- Recognition feels honoring, not pressuring
- No emergent “rank economy”

---

## 4) Post-Genesis phases (world maturation)

After G8 proves stable, the roadmap becomes long-horizon and optional.

### Phase W1 — Differentiation (history matters, not payment)
- Advanced permissions gated by time + Vitae, never payment
- Larger sinks introduced only for real utilities
- Begin limited governance on non-critical parameters

### Phase W2 — Circulation (value flows without corruption)
- Peer-to-peer exchange and creator economies stabilize
- Treasury programs become meaningful and auditable
- Stability guard begins to sunset

### Phase W3 — Interoperability (optional, intentional)
- External bridges/IBC only if internal rhythm remains dominant
- External exposure never overrides internal cadence
- Architect transitions toward stewardship

**Canonical invariant:**
> The Arcanum advances only when rhythm, integrity, and readiness align — never for urgency or speculation.

---

## 5) Required gates before advancing any phase

Before moving to the next phase, all must be true:

- Doctrine Guard passes
- Repo index integrity passes (canonical paths, no broken references)
- Layer boundary checks pass (no cross-layer semantic leakage)
- Dignity invariants are still intact (no pressure loops)
- Rollback plan exists and is tested (where applicable)
