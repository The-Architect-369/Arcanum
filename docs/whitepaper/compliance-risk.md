# Compliance Risk
> **Not legal advice.** This section outlines a design posture for a **user‑owned**, non‑custodial network. Engage qualified counsel before launch and prior to any jurisdictional expansion.

## 5.1 Operating Principles
- **User custodianship:** Arcanum does **not** centrally hold private keys or user funds.  
- **Minimal data retention:** The platform does **not** centrally store user PII or content; content is user‑posted and content‑addressed (e.g., IPFS).  
- **Community moderation:** Users govern content standards and enforcement through the **Governance Appendix** (e.g., voting to dissolve or de‑list rites).  
- **Transparency:** Parameters, fees, and treasury flows are recorded on-chain or published openly.

## 5.2 Content Responsibility
- **User‑generated content (UGC):** Users are responsible for the content they publish.  
- **Platform disclaimer:** Arcanum serves as a decentralized protocol; it does not pre‑screen nor assume liability for UGC.  
- **Takedown via governance:** Community may vote to hide/de‑list content from discovery layers while preserving content‑addressed integrity.

## 5.3 Data Protection & Privacy
- **Data minimization:** Collect only what is necessary for protocol function.  
- **GDPR/CCPA posture:** Favor local processing and user consent; enable data export where applicable.  
- **Selective disclosure:** Use attestations/zk‑friendly approaches for privacy‑preserving proofs where feasible.

## 5.4 Financial & Payments
- **Fiat on‑ramp:** Utilize third‑party providers for KYC/AML where required; Arcanum does not perform custodial fiat services.  
- **Utility positioning:** **Mana** is intended for on‑platform utility, not investment. Avoid representations that could imply profit expectations.  
- **Sanctions & restricted use:** Block interactions from sanctioned regions/services per provider requirements.

## 5.5 Intellectual Property
- **Creator rights:** Creators retain IP to their works unless they opt into open licenses.  
- **Protocol UI/Docs:** Consider permissive licenses (see §10).  
- **Infringement process:** Community moderation plus provider‑required procedures for notices.

## 5.6 Safety & Abuse
- **Prohibited conduct:** Define in Governance Appendix (harassment, illegal content, malware, etc.).  
- **Reporting & redress:** On‑chain/off‑chain reporting channels; documented response timelines.  
- **Minors:** Age‑appropriate access and controls where legally required.

## 5.7 Jurisdictions
- **Progressive rollout:** Start with a limited set of jurisdictions, expand as counsel advises.  
- **Localization:** Reflect local requirements in client UX where applicable.

## 5.8 Disclaimers
> This document is for information only and does not constitute legal, tax, or financial advice. Participation may carry risk, including loss of funds.
