# Appendix Governance
**Status:** v0.1 (subject to community ratification). This appendix is modular and may be updated independently of the main White Pages.

## 6.1 Core Principles (Draft — 10 Commandments)
1. **Human dignity:** Prioritize real humans and respectful conduct.  
2. **Consent & sovereignty:** Users control identity, keys, and data.  
3. **Transparency:** Rules, parameters, and treasury flows are open.  
4. **Fair reward:** Value flows to creators and contributors.  
5. **Non‑violence:** No harassment, threats, or targeted abuse.  
6. **Integrity:** No fraud, impersonation, or manipulation.  
7. **Stewardship:** Protect the commons; minimize spam and noise.  
8. **Privacy by default:** Favor privacy‑preserving designs and choices.  
9. **Pluralism:** Encourage diverse practices within shared bounds.  
10. **Accountability:** Breaches face proportionate, due‑process remedies.

> **Note:** Community may refine these and adopt amendments per §6.5.

## 6.2 Roles
- **Participants:** Post, purchase, vote, and contribute.  
- **Creators:** Publish rites/works; set pricing; earn Mana.  
- **Curators/Moderators:** Signal quality; initiate de‑listing proposals.  
- **Treasury Stewards:** Execute approved disbursements via multi‑sig.  
- **Architect (Stability Guard):** During alpha/beta only, may trigger **rollback** to a last stable state (see §6.8).

## 6.3 Proposals & Voting
- **Proposal types:** Parameter change, treasury allocation, content policy update, module upgrade, amendment.  
- **Lifecycle:** Draft → Temperature check → Formal proposal → Vote → Execution.  
- **Quorum & thresholds:** *TBD* (e.g., quorum 10% of active addresses; simple majority or supermajority by category).  
- **Voting power:** *TBD* (identity‑weighted, participation‑weighted, or mixed; avoid pure token plutocracy).  
- **Snapshot & execution:** Off‑chain snapshot voting with on‑chain execution, or fully on‑chain, as feasible.

## 6.4 Content Curation & Rite Dissolution
- **Signals:** Likes/tips (positive), flags (negative).  
- **Trigger:** If net negative signal crosses **TBD%** of recent viewers within **TBD** days, a de‑listing vote opens.  
- **Outcomes:** Keep (no action), De‑list from discovery, or Return to creator; underlying content hash remains addressable.

## 6.5 Amendments
- **Process:** Amendments to core principles or parameters follow the proposal lifecycle.  
- **Versioning:** Each ratified change increments **Appendix version** and adds to the **Amendment Log**.

## 6.6 Treasury Policy (Outline)
- **Budgets:** Recurring (ops, audits) and discretionary (grants).  
- **Controls:** Multi‑sig, time‑locks, and public reporting.  
- **Audits:** Periodic independent reviews.

## 6.7 Dispute Resolution
- **Mediation first;** escalate to formal vote if unresolved.  
- **Appeals:** Time‑boxed appeal window with higher quorum/supermajority.

## 6.8 Stability Guard (Time‑Limited)
- **Scope:** **Alpha/Beta** phases only, or until **v1.0** unless extended by vote.  
- **Powers:** Initiate **state rollback** to last approved stable snapshot; pause parameters in emergencies.  
- **Transparency:** Every action logged with rationale; automatic community review vote within **TBD** days.  
- **Sunset:** Powers expire unless renewed by supermajority.

## 6.9 Amendment Log (Initial)
- *v0.1* — Initial publication for community review.
