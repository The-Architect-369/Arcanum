# Tokenomics

## I. Overview

MANA is the native utility token of ARCnet.

It is designed to function as:

- A permission key
- An infrastructure access unit
- A governance weighting signal
- A treasury funding mechanism
- A coordination medium for developers

MANA is not designed as a speculative instrument.
It is designed as a utility-backed participation token.

Its economic structure prioritizes:

- Long-term sustainability
- Permissioned access
- Participation-weighted governance
- Controlled issuance
- Transparent sinks

---

# II. Economic Philosophy

The MANA economy is built on five principles:

---

## 1. Utility Before Exchange

MANA derives value from:

- Access rights
- Infrastructure usage
- Governance participation
- Developer integration
- Treasury operations

Exchange is secondary to use.

---

## 2. Time Over Capital

Authority cannot be purchased directly.

While MANA may be acquired:

- Governance weight depends on participation signals
- Progression gates cannot be bypassed through payment
- Time-based mechanics remain intact

Payment expands capacity.
It does not compress progression.

---

## 3. Earned and Purchased MANA

There are two acquisition paths:

### Earned MANA
- Distributed via protocol-defined reward mechanisms
- Granted for participation, cadence adherence, and module engagement
- Subject to emission schedules

### Purchased MANA
- Acquired through market exchange
- Economically equivalent at protocol level
- Does not grant accelerated governance privileges

Both forms are equal in transfer and utility.
Authority derives from identity and participation, not acquisition method.

---

## 4. Controlled Issuance

MANA supply is governed by:

- On-chain mint parameters
- Governance-controlled emission rates
- Treasury-defined allocation logic
- Constitutional constraints

Issuance is transparent and adjustable via governance within defined bounds.

No arbitrary minting authority exists outside protocol governance.

---

## 5. Structural Scarcity

Scarcity emerges from:

- Utility demand
- Governance participation
- Infrastructure usage
- Module activation
- Developer integration

Scarcity is not artificial.
It is driven by system participation.

---

# III. Genesis Economic Phase

The Genesis phase operates under a **permission-first posture**.

### Characteristics:

- Accessible participation
- Generous exploration rewards
- Minimal friction
- Limited sinks
- No pay-to-accelerate mechanics

The objective of Genesis is ecosystem stabilization, not revenue maximization.

During Genesis:

- MANA is abundant enough to enable exploration
- Governance authority remains partially restricted
- Treasury reserves are structured conservatively
- Validator incentives are stabilized

Genesis is an economic calibration phase.

---

# IV. Core Utility Functions

MANA is used for:

---

## 1. Access & Permissions

- Module unlocking
- Feature expansion
- Developer tools access
- Governance proposal submission
- Advanced system participation

---

## 2. Governance Participation

- Proposal deposits
- Voting weight (combined with identity metrics)
- Parameter modification authority

Governance power is influenced by MANA but not determined solely by holdings.

---

## 3. Infrastructure Usage

- Storage anchoring
- Module execution
- Network resource allocation
- Future compute allocation

As ARCnet expands, infrastructure use becomes a primary sink.

---

## 4. Developer Integration

External developers may:

- Integrate MANA as payment rails
- Deploy modules using MANA-based execution
- Pay for infrastructure bandwidth
- Access governance-linked APIs

This creates systemic demand beyond consumer usage.

---

## 5. Treasury Interaction

MANA may be:

- Allocated via governance
- Directed to ecosystem development
- Used for validator incentives
- Used to fund protocol upgrades

Treasury transparency is enforced on-chain.

---

# V. Token Sinks

Long-term sustainability requires consistent sinks.

Primary sinks include:

- Module activation costs
- Governance proposal deposits
- Infrastructure usage fees
- Developer deployment fees
- Optional premium utilities
- Treasury funding allocations

Sinks are designed to:

- Encourage responsible usage
- Prevent runaway inflation
- Support ecosystem development

Sinks are utility-bound, not cosmetic extraction mechanisms.

---

# VI. Governance Weighting Model

Governance influence is multi-factorial:

- MANA stake
- Identity longevity (ACC age)
- Participation consistency
- Vitae progression signals
- Reputation metrics (future modules)

This prevents simple capital dominance.

MANA alone does not determine authority.

---

# VII. Validator Incentives

Validators are incentivized via:

- Block rewards
- Governance-approved treasury allocations
- Transaction fees
- Staking participation

Slashing mechanisms penalize:

- Double signing
- Downtime
- Malicious behavior

Validator economics are transparent and parameterized.

---

# VIII. Long-Term Sustainability

Sustainability is driven by:

- Utility demand growth
- Developer ecosystem integration
- Infrastructure consumption
- Governance participation
- Treasury management discipline

The economic model assumes:

- Gradual decentralization
- Expanding module ecosystem
- Interoperability via IBC
- Cross-chain liquidity optionality

Revenue is derived from infrastructure usage, not psychological extraction.

---

# IX. Regulatory Positioning

MANA is designed as:

- A utility token
- A participation medium
- A governance signal
- An infrastructure access unit

It is not:

- An equity instrument
- A dividend-bearing asset
- A revenue share mechanism
- A profit guarantee structure

Protocol governance controls issuance and utility within defined constitutional bounds.

---

# X. Economic Trajectory

The MANA economy evolves in phases:

1. Genesis — Permission-first access
2. Awakening — Controlled circulation
3. Differentiation — Meaningful sinks emerge
4. Circulation — External developer demand increases
5. Interoperability — Cross-chain integration

Each phase increases utility depth before expanding monetary complexity.

---

# Conclusion

MANA is not designed to be traded.
It is designed to be used.

Its value emerges from:

- Access
- Infrastructure
- Governance
- Participation
- Development

The economic model prioritizes sustainability over velocity.

Authority is earned.
Utility drives demand.
Governance maintains balance.

This is a participation economy, not a speculation engine.
