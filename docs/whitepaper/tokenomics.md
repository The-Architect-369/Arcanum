# Tokenomics
**Genesis Ontology: Capacity and Value**

---

## 1. Purpose of Mana

**Mana** is the native unit of participation within the Arcanum.

It exists to:

* Grant **permission to act**
* Enable access to **technology, features, and rituals**
* Mediate the relationship between **presence, effort, and capability**
* Provide a transferable unit of **utility and value** within and beyond the system

Mana is not introduced as an abstraction for speculation. It is introduced as a *living resource* — meaningful only through use.

---

## 2. Ontology of Mana

Mana is a **single primitive** with **two inseparable dimensions**:

1. **Capacity** — permission to perform actions
2. **Value** — transferable utility recognized by others

These dimensions coexist, but they are governed by **different rules**.

---

## 3. Mana as Capacity (Primary at Genesis)

At Genesis, Mana is first and foremost **capacity**.

Capacity means:

* The *right* to invoke a feature
* The *ability* to perform an action
* The *permission* to access technology

When a participant receives Mana on day one:

> **They are being given permission — not an understanding of value.**

The value of that permission is revealed only through:

* Engagement
* Progression
* Time
* Context within the Arcanum

### Key Properties

* Mana enables actions but does not define outcomes
* Mana may unlock *breadth*, not *speed*
* Mana never accelerates time-based progression
* Mana never bypasses identity, ritual, or Vitae thresholds

Capacity is always subordinate to:

* **Tempus** (time and rhythm)
* **Identity** (continuity of the being)
* **Vitae** (becoming and progression)

No amount of Mana can replace presence.

---

## 4. Mana as Value (Always Real, Never Dominant)

Mana is also **value**.

This means:

* Mana is transferable between participants
* Mana may be exchanged freely
* Mana may be purchased directly from the Arcanum
* Mana may interact with external markets or networks

However:

> **Value does not override capacity.**

Owning Mana does not grant authority, trust, or maturity. Value represents **potential utility**, not entitlement.

---

## 5. Acquisition of Mana

Mana may be acquired through multiple legitimate paths:

### 5.1 Genesis Grant

* New participants may receive Mana freely
* This Mana is fully real and fully usable
* Free Mana is not restricted or second-class

### 5.2 Earned Mana

* Mana may be earned through participation
* Rituals, presence, contribution, and engagement may yield Mana
* Earned Mana reinforces the relationship between effort and permission

### 5.3 Purchased Mana

* Mana may be purchased directly from the Arcanum
* This is the primary revenue mechanism of the system
* No microtransactions, ads, or extractive mechanics exist

Purchased Mana increases *available capacity*, not progression speed.

---

## 6. Spending Mana (Sinks)

Mana is spent to:

* Activate or access technology
* Enable features or permissions
* Interact with advanced systems
* Participate in higher-order rituals or tools

Mana is never spent to:

* Skip time
* Skip rites
* Skip progression
* Override governance
* Purchase authority over others

---

## 7. Mana and Vitae

**Vitae** represents becoming — not consumption.

Mana may be required to unlock access to Vitae grades or learning layers. However:

* Vitae advancement is time-bound
* Vitae advancement is ritual-bound
* Vitae advancement is identity-bound

Mana enables entry into a gate. **Vitae determines when the gate opens.**

---

## 8. Core Invariant (Non-Negotiable)

> **Mana may unlock permission, but may never accelerate time-based progression or bypass Vitae thresholds.**

This invariant preserves fairness, integrity, and alignment with Arcanum principles.

---

## 9. Genesis Declaration

At Genesis, Mana is declared as follows:

> **Mana is granted as permission, tradable as value, spent as utility, earned through presence, purchased by choice — but always subordinate to time, identity, and becoming.**

---

## 10. Evolution Over Time

The behavior of Mana may evolve through governance:

* New sinks may be introduced
* New permissions may emerge
* External interoperability may be enabled

Its core ontology — **capacity before value** — remains foundational.

Mana is not a promise of profit. Mana is a medium of participation in a living system.
