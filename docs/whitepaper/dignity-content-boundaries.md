\## \*\*Purpose\*\*



The Arcanum is structured to preserve human dignity, interior sovereignty, and psychological well-being.



This document defines content boundaries necessary to protect:







\* Practitioners

\* Minors

\* Communities

\* The integrity of the digital commons



These boundaries are grounded in dignity and harm prevention, not moral ideology.





---





\## \*\*Foundational Principle: Human Dignity\*\*



Within the Arcanum:







\* Human beings are not consumable objects.

\* Interior life is sacred and protected.

\* Exploitation is structurally incompatible with the system.



Content policies exist to preserve this foundation.





---





\## \*\*Non-Negotiable Prohibitions\*\*



The following are strictly prohibited:





\### \*\*1️⃣ Exploitation of Minors\*\*







\* Sexual content involving minors

\* Suggestive representation of minors

\* Grooming behavior

\* Distribution of exploitative material



This prohibition is absolute.





---





\### \*\*2️⃣ Sexual Commodification\*\*



The Arcanum prohibits explicit sexual content intended for:







\* Commercial gain

\* Engagement harvesting

\* Attention monetization

\* Objectification-based influence



The system does not support:







\* Pornographic distribution

\* Algorithmic sexual amplification

\* Economic incentives tied to sexualized display



Expression of embodiment is not prohibited.



Commodification of embodiment is.





---





\### \*\*3️⃣ Promotion of Violence\*\*



Content that directly promotes:







\* Physical violence

\* Organized harm

\* Terroristic activity

\* Coercive abuse



Is prohibited.



Discussion of violence in educational, journalistic, or analytical context is permitted.





---





\### \*\*4️⃣ Dehumanization\*\*



Content that:







\* Reduces individuals or groups to subhuman status

\* Advocates removal of rights based on identity

\* Encourages hatred toward protected groups



Is subject to intervention.



The Arcanum protects pluralism and dissent. \\

It does not protect dehumanization.





---





\### \*\*5️⃣ Coordinated Psychological Harm\*\*



The Arcanum prohibits:







\* Targeted harassment campaigns

\* Coordinated bullying

\* Manipulative emotional exploitation

\* Systematic humiliation



Behavioral harm is governable.





---





\## \*\*Expression vs Exploitation\*\*



The Arcanum distinguishes between:



Expression:







\* Personal embodiment

\* Artistic exploration

\* Cultural identity

\* Self-representation



Exploitation:







\* Objectification for attention

\* Economic gain through sexualization

\* Psychological manipulation

\* Identity commodification



Structural incentives for exploitation are removed by design.





---





\## \*\*No Moral Policing Clause\*\*



The Arcanum does not:







\* Enforce religious purity codes

\* Police consensual adult relationships

\* Regulate private lawful behavior

\* Enforce ideological sexual doctrine



Boundaries are based on harm and dignity — not morality frameworks.







---

\*\*Structural Safeguards\*\*



The system architecture supports dignity through:







\* Absence of engagement ranking

\* Absence of paid amplification

\* Absence of virality loops

\* Non-monetization of attention



Without amplification, exploitation loses incentive.



---







\## \*\*Intervention Criteria\*\*



Moderation intervention may occur when:







\* Direct harm is promoted

\* Exploitation is evident

\* Coercion is encouraged

\* Minors are endangered



Intervention must be:







\* Documented

\* Transparent

\* Consistent

\* Reviewable



Belief alone is not grounds for intervention.



Behavior is.





---





\## \*\*Alignment With Constitutional Principles\*\*



All content boundaries must remain aligned with:







\* METAPHYSICAL\_NEUTRALITY\_PRINCIPLE

\* GOVERNANCE\_AND\_NEUTRALITY

\* FOUNDER\_TRANSITION\_AND\_ARCHETYPE



No content policy may introduce metaphysical doctrine or ideological enforcement.





---





\## \*\*Long-Term Civilizational Position\*\*



The Arcanum is not a free-for-all.



It is a sanctuary for interior sovereignty.



Sanctuaries require boundaries.



Boundaries protect clarity.
