# Problem Solution
## 2.1 Problem Statement
1. **Identity dilution & bots.** Anonymous, disposable identities enable spam and erode trust.  
2. **Centralized gatekeeping.** Platforms monetize attention and data; users surrender control and upside.  
3. **Value misalignment.** Creative and spiritual labor is under‑rewarded; healthy participation is not systematically incentivized.  
4. **Fragmented experiences.** Tools for practice, learning, social exchange, and governance live in silos with incompatible incentives.  
5. **Content custodianship risks.** Central operators face legal exposure and censorial pressures that distort community norms.

## 2.2 Solution Overview
**Arcanum** aligns **identity → practice → value → governance**:
- **Soul‑bound identity (DID/SBI):** Persistent, non‑transferable identity records key attestations and progress.  
- **Practice‑to‑earn:** **Tempest** daily rites mint **Mana** as a reward for verified engagement.  
- **Creator economy:** **Arknet** lets creators post rites/works; peers purchase, like (tip), and remix—routing Mana to creators.  
- **Knowledge access:** **Vitae** (a library of magical/transformative texts) is accessible via Mana.  
- **Stateful guidance:** **Hope** provides state/memory updates (fee in Mana) that tailor user experience.  
- **Community governance:** Proposals, voting, and a living rulebook curate the commons without central gatekeepers.

**Outcomes:** Authentic participation, fair rewards, portable reputation, and a resilient, user‑owned network.
