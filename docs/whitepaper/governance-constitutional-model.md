\# Governance \& Constitutional Model



\## I. Governance Philosophy



ARCnet governance is not designed as pure majoritarian voting.



It is designed as \*\*constitutional coordination\*\*.



The system balances:



\- Participation

\- Identity continuity

\- Economic stake

\- Time-in-system

\- Structural invariants



Governance exists to:



\- Maintain system integrity

\- Allocate treasury resources

\- Adjust bounded parameters

\- Approve protocol upgrades

\- Protect dignity boundaries



It does not exist to override core invariants.



---



\# II. Constitutional Hierarchy



ARCnet governance operates within a defined hierarchy:



1\. \*\*Constitutional Invariants (Non-Overridable)\*\*

2\. \*\*Protocol Parameters (Governance Adjustable)\*\*

3\. \*\*Treasury Allocation Decisions\*\*

4\. \*\*Module-Level Governance\*\*

5\. \*\*Application-Level Policies\*\*



This hierarchy ensures:



\- Stability at the core

\- Flexibility at the edges

\- Evolution without fragility



---



\# III. Constitutional Invariants



The following invariants cannot be overridden by governance vote:



\- Identity cannot be duplicated.

\- Time-based progression cannot be accelerated through payment.

\- Minting cannot bypass protocol limits.

\- Treasury funds cannot be extracted without governance process.

\- Governance authority cannot be assigned purely through capital.

\- Constitutional structure cannot be modified without supermajority and time-lock.



These invariants protect long-term coherence.



They are enforced at protocol level.



---



\# IV. Governance Weighting Model



Governance influence is multi-factorial.



Voting power may be derived from:



\- MANA stake

\- Identity longevity (ACC age)

\- Participation consistency

\- Vitae progression milestones

\- Delegation mechanics



This prevents:



\- Pure plutocracy

\- Identity farming

\- Governance capture through capital alone



Authority is accumulated through sustained participation.



---



\# V. Governance Phases



Governance evolves over time.



\## Phase 1: Genesis Stability



\- Architect Stability Guard active

\- Limited proposal surface

\- Parameter tuning only

\- Validator set curated



Objective: preserve early integrity.



---



\## Phase 2: Observational Activation



\- Expanded proposal submission

\- Limited treasury routing

\- Increased validator distribution

\- Governance metrics tested



Objective: stress-test governance mechanics.



---



\## Phase 3: Structured Differentiation



\- Full proposal surface

\- Developer module proposals

\- Treasury expansion

\- Validator decentralization



Objective: partial decentralization.



---



\## Phase 4: Circulation



\- Broad governance eligibility

\- Mature validator distribution

\- Treasury governed by community

\- ARCnet used beyond Arcanum



Objective: resilient governance network.



---



\# VI. Proposal Types



Governance proposals may include:



\- Parameter adjustments

\- Treasury allocation

\- Module approval

\- Validator onboarding rules

\- Economic emission adjustments

\- IBC channel approvals

\- Protocol upgrade scheduling



Each proposal type has:



\- Required quorum

\- Required threshold

\- Time-lock duration

\- Execution rules



---



\# VII. Treasury Governance



Treasury rules:



\- All allocations require proposal approval.

\- Execution must follow time-lock.

\- Multi-sig safeguards may exist in early phases.

\- Treasury transparency is public and on-chain.



Treasury may fund:



\- Infrastructure upgrades

\- Developer grants

\- Validator incentives

\- Security audits

\- Ecosystem expansion



Treasury cannot:



\- Directly enrich insiders without proposal.

\- Override invariants.

\- Issue unlimited mint.



---



\# VIII. Delegation \& Representation



Delegation may allow:



\- Stake delegation to validators

\- Governance delegation to representatives

\- Participation pooling



Delegation does not:



\- Override identity metrics

\- Remove constitutional constraints



Delegation enhances scalability without centralization.



---



\# IX. Governance Security



Governance security mechanisms include:



\- Proposal deposits (anti-spam)

\- Slashing penalties

\- Time-lock execution

\- Parameter bounds

\- Supermajority requirements for structural change



The goal is to prevent rapid destabilization.



---



\# X. Relationship to Application Governance



The Arcanum application may include:



\- Module-level governance

\- Community moderation structures

\- Content policy refinement



However:



Application governance cannot override ARCnet constitutional invariants.



Chain > Module > Application.



---



\# XI. Long-Term Objective



The long-term objective of governance is:



\- Decentralized validator distribution

\- Participation-weighted authority

\- Sustainable treasury funding

\- Developer composability

\- Infrastructure-level neutrality



Governance must mature as participation matures.



Decentralization is phased, not immediate.



---



\# Conclusion



ARCnet governance is constitutional before it is democratic.



It binds authority to time and participation.



It protects core invariants while enabling evolution.



The objective is not rapid decision-making.



The objective is long-term stability.
