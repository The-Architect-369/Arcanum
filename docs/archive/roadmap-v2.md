# Roadmap V2
**Sovereign Genesis → Living World**

---

## 0. Roadmap Philosophy

The Arcanum roadmap does not describe a product rollout.
It describes the **emergence of a world**.

Each phase represents a **qualitative state of the system**, not merely a technical milestone. Progression through phases is governed by **readiness and integrity**, not urgency or external pressure.

The Arcanum is **sovereign by design**. Its blockchain, economy, identity, and rhythm are internally defined and externally interoperable by choice, not dependency.

---

## Genesis Economy — Permission-First Phase

At Genesis, the Arcanum adopts a **permission-first economic posture**.

* Mana is abundant enough to enable exploration
* Scarcity is enforced through **time, identity, and progression**, not price
* Free participation is fully viable
* Purchased Mana expands **capacity**, never authority or speed

Genesis is not a market launch. Genesis is the awakening of a world.

---

## Phase I — Genesis

**Chain Birth & World Formation**

**Question answered:** *Can the world exist?*

Genesis is the moment the Arcanum becomes a sovereign reality.

### Characteristics

* Sovereign Arcanum blockchain initialized (Cosmos-based)
* Validator set established (minimal, trusted, expandable)
* Identity system (ACC / ChainCode) live
* Mana minting under protocol control
* Genesis Mana grants enabled
* No external dependency for gas, settlement, or execution

### Economic Posture

* Mana is permission-first
* Earned and purchased Mana are equally valid
* No microtransactions
* No paywalls on identity
* No acceleration of time-based progression

### Governance

* Architect Stability Guard active
* Core invariants enforced
* Governance structures defined but not yet activated

**Outcome:**

> The Arcanum exists as a living system.

---

## Phase II — Awakening

**Closed World, Living Participation**

**Question answered:** *Can beings meaningfully live inside it?*

Awakening is a protected phase focused on rhythm, experience, and integrity.

### Characteristics

* Controlled onboarding (invite, rate-limited, or cohort-based)
* Hope, Tempus, and foundational systems active
* Mana used to unlock permissions and technology
* Time-based cadence enforced via Tempus
* Early Vitae layers accessible

### Economic Posture

* Free-to-play path fully viable
* Paid Mana expands capacity, not authority
* Mana sinks limited to core utilities
* No external market pressure prioritized

### Governance

* Observation and tuning
* No binding voting yet
* Data gathered on pacing, balance, and behavior

**Outcome:**

> The system breathes. Participation has texture and meaning.

---

## Phase III — Differentiation

**Meaningful Scarcity & Progression**

**Question answered:** *Do actions and history matter?*

Differentiation introduces long-form identity, consequence, and commitment.

### Characteristics

* Vitae progression deepens
* Clear differentiation between novice and mature participants
* Advanced permissions gated by **time + Vitae**, never by payment
* System complexity increases responsibly

### Economic Posture

* Larger Mana sinks introduced (e.g. major feature access)
* Long-horizon earning paths become visible
* Mana circulation increases organically
* Scarcity emerges from commitment, not price

### Governance

* Initial governance mechanisms activated
* Limited voting on non-critical parameters
* Community voice begins shaping evolution

**Outcome:**

> Not all actions are equal. History becomes visible.

---

## Phase IV — Circulation

**Economy & Governance Emerge**

**Question answered:** *Can value circulate without corruption?*

Circulation is where the Arcanum economy becomes self-aware and stable.

### Characteristics

* Robust peer-to-peer Mana exchange
* Deeper feature ecosystems unlocked
* Creative and technological use cases expand
* System supports complex participant roles

### Economic Posture

* Mana economy stabilizes through use
* Treasury functions become relevant
* Paid Mana becomes a meaningful support mechanism
* Economic behavior reflects lived value, not speculation

### Governance

* Expanded governance rights
* Voting tied to identity, participation, and Vitae
* Stability Guard begins to sunset

**Outcome:**

> Value flows through participation, not extraction.

---

## Phase V — Interoperability

**Cosmos Expansion & External Connection**

**Question answered:** *Can the Arcanum speak to other worlds without losing itself?*

Interoperability is optional and intentional.

### Characteristics

* Selective IBC channels enabled
* External asset and identity bridges considered
* Arcanum remains sovereign and non-dependent
* External exposure increases responsibly

### Economic Posture

* Mana may interact with external markets
* Internal rules remain dominant
* External value never overrides internal rhythm

### Governance

* Full community governance
* Protocol-level decisions decentralized
* Architect role transitions to stewardship

**Outcome:**

> The Arcanum is sovereign, connected, and mature.

## What This Roadmap Is Not

* It is not a promise of dates
* It is not a growth-at-all-costs plan
* It is not a speculative market launch schedule
* It is not driven by external chains or investors

---

## Canonical Roadmap Invariant

> **The Arcanum advances phases only when rhythm, integrity, and readiness align — never to satisfy urgency or speculation.**
