# Readme
**Date:** 2025-10-26

This repository contains the modular “White Pages” for the **Arcanum**, a self-governing ecosystem tool and sacred digital commons. It is structured for clarity, versioning, and community collaboration.

> **How to use**  
> - Read `01-Executive-Summary.md` first for the big picture.  
> - Each major section lives in its own Markdown file for easy editing.  
> - Governance is designed as a **living appendix** that can be updated independently.  
> - Convert to PDF/Word using tools like Pandoc when ready for distribution.

## Table of Contents
1. [Executive Summary](01-Executive-Summary.md)
2. [Problem & Solution Overview](02-Problem-Solution.md)
3. [Technical Architecture](03-Technical-Architecture.md)
4. [Tokenomics — Mana](04-Tokenomics.md)
5. [Compliance & Risk Posture](05-Compliance-and-Risk.md)
6. [Governance Appendix (Living Doc)](06-Governance-Appendix.md)
7. [Roadmap](07-Roadmap.md)
8. [Glossary](08-Glossary.md)
9. [Changelog](09-Changelog.md)
10. [License & Attribution](10-License-and-Attribution.md)

## Editing & Versioning
- Treat each commit as a **release candidate**. Maintain release notes in `09-Changelog.md`.
- When governance rules change, update **only** `06-Governance-Appendix.md` and bump the appendix sub-version (e.g., `Appendix v0.3`).

## Single-File Build
If you prefer a single-file version, see `arcanum-white-pages-SINGLE.md` (auto-generated concatenation of all sections).
