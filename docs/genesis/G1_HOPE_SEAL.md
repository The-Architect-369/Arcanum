\# G1 HOPE — SEAL



Status: SEALED  

Date: <2026-02-08>  

Phase: Genesis G1 — Presence \& Reflection



\## What Exists

\- Public, ungated HOPE presence surface

\- Anonymous, ephemeral reflection editor

\- G1 reflection schema enforced on submit

\- Non-persistent witness window (read-only, capped)

\- No identity, no economy, no metrics, no pressure



\## What Is Intentionally Absent

\- Persistence or guarantees

\- Identity or wallets

\- Reactions, counts, rankings

\- Engagement optimization

\- Marketing pressure



\## Non-Negotiable Boundaries

The following are \*\*forbidden in G1 HOPE\*\*:

\- Persistence of witness data

\- Public display of reflection text

\- Timestamps, counts, or reactions

\- Identity, wallets, accounts, or economy hooks

\- Calls to action that pressure posting or return



Any change crossing these boundaries \*\*advances the phase\*\* and must be treated as post-G1 work.
