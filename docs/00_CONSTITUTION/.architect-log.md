## [SYNC EVENT — 2025-10-20 | Tempest Architecture Finalization]

**Version Summary**
- Core File: `ArchitectGPT_Core.md` — v2.1  
- Extended File: `ArchitectGPT_Extended.md` — v2.1  
- Treasury Spec: `TREASURY_CONSTITUTION.md` — v1.0

- Repository: https://github.com/The-Architect-369/Arcanum.git

### **Architectural Overview**
**Subsystem:** `Tempus` (codename “Tempest”)  
**Purpose:** To unify chronological, celestial, and esoteric data into a harmonic time interface — mapping human events, planetary motion, and MANA energy flow within a single experiential framework.

---

### **Finalized Design Decisions**

| Layer | Description | Core Technology |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Temporal Grid Layer** | Foundational time structure (daily/weekly/monthly). | `React Big Calendar`, `Day.js`, Tailwind |
| **Celestial Computation Layer** | Planetary/zodiacal calculation system. | `Astronomy Engine`, Ephemerides |
| **Symbolic Overlay Layer** | Renders alchemical glyphs and planetary transits. | `Framer Motion`, `D3.js`, SVG/Canvas |
| **MANA Integration Layer** | Connects celestial events to reward logic and treasury. | `Arcanum Reward Contracts`, `MANA` |
| **UI Harmony Layer** | Thematic alignment — Tailwind color tokens and motion harmony. | `Tailwind`, `Lucide`, custom icons |

### **Symbolic & Esoteric Integration**
- Zodiac houses represented as 12 radial harmonic sectors (360° division).  
- Planetary glyphs use alchemical iconography from Arcanum’s visual library.  
- Celestial transits and lunar phases dynamically trigger MANA reward events.  
- Animations expressed through “transmutation pulses” — subtle auric glows upon celestial conjunctions.

---

### **Reward System Alignment**
Linked to `TEMPUS_REWARD_SYSTEM_CALENDAR.md`:
- Each celestial alignment or phase change can mint MANA or activate symbolic events.
- Treasury logic mirrors 10/20/70 allocation model (Architect / Development / Community).
- All activity logged and time-stamped for governance participation scoring.

---

### **Integration Map**
**APIs & Flows:**
- Astronomy Engine → CelestialEvent Stream → Overlay Renderer  
- Overlay Renderer → RewardTriggerEngine → MANA Contract (Ethereum JSON-RPC)  
- Treasury API (Gnosis Safe) → MANA Ledger Sync  
- Transak/BTCPay → Onboarding Bridge → Tempus Activation  

---

### **Harmony & Design Notes**
- Tailwind theming extended with `bg-harmony-*` and `text-alchemy-*` palettes.  
- All motion follows `ease-in-out duration-700` to preserve visual serenity.  
- Optional resonance chime on celestial event detection (future aural layer).  

---

### **Phase Context**
| Phase | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Pre-Genesis | ✅ Defined | Structural design and doctrinal alignment finalized. |
| Genesis I | ⏳ Pending | Begin implementation of grid + celestial overlay. |
| Foundation | Planned | Integrate Treasury, MANA, and reward system calls. |

---

### **Maintainer Note**
> “The Tempest marks the convergence of time and consciousness.  
>  Through harmony, celestial order, and communal flow, it transforms the passage of days into a living symphony of creation.”
