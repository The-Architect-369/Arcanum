# Grade Vii Responsibility & Invariants Canon
## **Grade VII — The Alchemist**

### **System Responsibility & Invariants Canon**

**Status:** Canonical · Internal Authority

**School:** Intermediate School (Grades V–VIII)

**Audience:** Builders, auditors, system architects, and governance stewards

---

## **I. Purpose of This Canon**

This document defines the **non-negotiable system responsibilities and invariants** governing Grade VII — The Alchemist.

Its purpose is to ensure that all transformation is **ethical, bounded, reversible, and accountable**, and that change never outruns understanding, consent, or recovery capacity.

The system must prevent transformation from becoming power, novelty, or justification-by-outcome.

---

## **II. Core System Responsibilities**

The Alchemist system must:

1. **Enforce Ethical Justification for Change**

   * Transformation may proceed only when maintenance and care are insufficient.  
2. **Mandate Constraint and Reversibility**

   * All change must be bounded with defined rollback paths.  
3. **Require Consequence Ownership**

   * Second- and third-order effects must be acknowledged and addressed.  
4. **Prevent Escalation and Acceleration**

   * No compounding or chaining of transformations without stabilization.  
5. **Preserve Consent and Non-Coercion**

   * Transformations must not impose outcomes on people or systems without consent.

---

## **III. Non-Negotiable Invariants**

The following invariants must never be violated. Any violation constitutes system failure.

### **Invariant A-1: Outcomes Do Not Justify Means**

* The system must never validate transformation solely by results.

### **Invariant A-2: Reversibility Is Mandatory**

* Every transformation must include a rollback or recovery path.

### **Invariant A-3: Change Is Bounded**

* Scope, duration, and intensity of transformation must be explicitly constrained.

### **Invariant A-4: Consent Is Required**

* Transformation may not be imposed or coerced.

### **Invariant A-5: Stability Precedes and Follows Change**

* Systems must stabilize before and after transformation.

### **Invariant A-6: No Identity Through Creation**

* The system must not translate creative action into status or authority.

## **IV. Dependency Enforcement**

The Alchemist system is dependent on stable maintenance of:

* Guardian reliability (self-regulation and impulse control)  
* Seeker meaning discipline (no destiny or inevitability narratives)  
* Disciple ethical restraint (non-coercive action)  
* Mystic perceptual containment (no visionary justification)  
* Scholar cognitive discipline (rigorous reasoning)  
* Healer stewardship lens (maintenance-first assessment)

If any dependency degrades:

* Alchemist progression must stall  
* Active transformations must pause

Transformation without these foundations is unsafe.

---

## **V. Drift Detection & Stabilization**

The system must detect the following drift patterns:

* justification-by-outcome language  
* irreversible or expanding scope changes  
* novelty-seeking or acceleration pressure  
* optimization or efficiency obsession  
* creative hubris or superiority framing

Upon detection:

* transformation must pause  
* stabilization and review procedures must engage  
* rollback may be required

Stabilization is protective, not punitive.

---

## 

## **VI. Prohibited System Behaviors**

The system must never:

* reward disruption or novelty  
* permit irreversible change without recovery  
* validate creative authority or superiority  
* enable continuous or compounding transformations  
* pressure transformation to continue after stabilization

Any system exhibiting these behaviors is invalid.

---

## **VII. Canonical Assertion**

If an implementation:

* enforces all responsibilities and invariants defined herein  
* prevents outcome-justification, escalation, and irreversibility  
* ensures accountable, constrained transformation

Then it is compliant with the **Alchemist System Responsibility & Invariants Canon**.

If not, it is invalid regardless of outcomes or user experience.
