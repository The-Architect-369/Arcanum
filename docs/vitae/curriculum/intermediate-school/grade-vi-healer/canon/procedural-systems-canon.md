# Grade Vi Procedural Systems Canon
## **Grade VI — The Healer**

### **Procedural Systems Canon**

**Status:** Canonical · Internal Authority

**School:** Intermediate School (Grades V–VIII)

**Audience:** Builders, system architects, auditors, and governance stewards

---

## **I. Purpose of the Procedural Systems Canon**

This document defines **how care, maintenance, and restoration must behave procedurally** within Grade VI — The Healer.

It does not specify curriculum, techniques, or domains of care. It specifies the **rules governing interaction, pacing, limits, and withdrawal** so that care remains ethical, bounded, and non-authoritative.

---

## **II. Procedural Orientation**

All Healer procedures must conform to the following orientation:

* Care is offered, never imposed  
* Intervention is minimal and proportional  
* Maintenance is favored over correction  
* Withdrawal is structurally valid  
* Restoration prioritizes sustainability

No procedure may reward emotional intensity, self-sacrifice, or permanence of involvement.

---

## 

## **III. Initiation of Care Procedures**

Care-related procedures must:

1. **Require Clear Consent**

   * Care is only initiated when conditions permit non-coercive engagement.  
2. **Define Scope Explicitly**

   * Duration, depth, and limits must be declared.  
3. **Remain System-Focused**

   * Emphasis is placed on environments, processes, or structures rather than individuals.  
4. **Permit Refusal at Any Stage**

   * Either party may disengage without penalty.

---

## **IV. Maintenance & Restoration Cycles**

The system must operate care in **cycles**, not continuous engagement:

* observation phase  
* minimal intervention phase  
* stabilization phase  
* withdrawal phase

No procedure may remain indefinitely active.

Maintenance cycles must include built-in pauses and reassessment.

---

**V. Withdrawal & Refusal Mechanics**

The system must normalize:

* clean withdrawal from care processes  
* refusal without justification  
* cessation upon stabilization

Withdrawal is treated as successful completion, not abandonment.

---

**VI. Burnout Prevention & Load Monitoring**

The system must:

* monitor duration and frequency of care engagement  
* enforce rest and recovery intervals  
* stall progression when depletion risk is detected

Care capacity is finite and must be protected.

---

## **VII. Handling Care Drift**

When drift is detected (dependency, authority, overextension):

* care procedures must suspend  
* boundary reinforcement procedures activate  
* reflection and reassessment are required

The system corrects structure, not motivation.

---

## **VIII. Temporal Governance**

Time governs care.

The system must enforce:

* bounded engagement windows  
* mandatory recovery intervals  
* prohibition of continuous intervention

Time-based constraints may not be bypassed.

---

## 

## 

## **IX. Prohibited Procedures**

The system must never implement:

* open-ended care loops  
* emotionally escalated interventions  
* savior-oriented framing  
* outcome-driven persistence  
* identity-based care roles

Any such procedure invalidates the grade.

---

## **X. Canonical Assertion**

If an implementation:

* enforces the procedural constraints defined herein  
* maintains limits, consent, and withdrawal  
* prevents dependency, authority, and burnout

Then it is compliant with the **Healer Procedural Systems Canon**.

If not, it is invalid regardless of outcomes or user experience.
