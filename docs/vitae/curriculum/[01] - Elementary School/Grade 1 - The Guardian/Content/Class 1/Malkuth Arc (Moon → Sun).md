# Malkuth Arc (moon → Sun)

## **Ⅰ. Class 1 Arc (Moon → Sun)**

Class 1 is doing something very precise, and it *is* coherent.

### **The Arc in One Sentence**

**Class 1 teaches the body how to be inhabited without distortion.**

Here’s how each chapter contributes, and why nothing is redundant:

---

### **🌑 Moon — Awareness**

**Function:** Learning to notice without interference  
 **Key Transition:** *From absence → attention*  
 The practitioner learns that sensation exists before control.

“Awareness precedes change.”

This establishes **perceptual honesty**.

---

**♂ Mars — Effort**

**Function:** Learning the difference between effort and force  
 **Key Transition:** *From attention → activation*  
 The practitioner encounters power and tension without moral framing.

“Effort and force are not the same.”

This establishes **regulated activation**.

---

**☿ Mercury — Coordination**

**Function:** Learning that attention organizes movement  
 **Key Transition:** *From activation → coordination*  
 The body is revealed as a communicating system.

“Attention shapes experience.”

This establishes **internal communication**.

---

### **♃ Jupiter — Capacity**

**Function:** Learning sustainable expansion  
 **Key Transition:** *From coordination → endurance*  
 The practitioner discovers limits as signals, not failures.

“Boundaries allow strength to endure.”

This establishes **measured growth**.

---

**♀ Venus — Care**

**Function:** Learning how comfort alters physiology  
 **Key Transition:** *From endurance → harmony*  
 The body responds differently when met with care.

“Harmony arises when force is replaced with attunement.”

This establishes **self-regulation through gentleness**.

---

**♄ Saturn — Structure**

**Function:** Learning support, limits, and alignment  
 **Key Transition:** *From harmony → stability*  
 Structure becomes protective rather than restrictive.

“Structure is not restriction; it is support.”

This establishes **reliability and containment**.

---

**☉ Sun — Coherence**

**Function:** Learning wholeness without transcendence  
 **Key Transition:** *From stability → integration*  
 The body is experienced as one system.

“Integration is not addition; it is coherence.”

This establishes **embodied presence**.
