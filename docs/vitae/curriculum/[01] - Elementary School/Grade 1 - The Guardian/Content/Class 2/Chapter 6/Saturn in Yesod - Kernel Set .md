* Stillness strengthens containment.  
* Boundaries prevent emotional leakage.

---

### **4\. Required Conceptual Moves**

* Upright or grounded posture  
* Breath allowed to settle naturally  
* Awareness maintained throughout sensation

---

### **6\. Prohibited Framing**

* Endurance challenges  
* Emotional shutdown  
* Performance metrics

---

### **7\. Completion Condition**

The practitioner remains present within emotional boundaries.

---

## **WATER KERNEL — Reflection on Boundaries**

### **1\. Core Function**

Integrate awareness of emotional containment and limits through reflection.

---

### **2\. Reflection Medium**

* Voice → text transcription  
* Stored for longitudinal reference

---

### **3\. Canonical Truths**

* Reflection clarifies limits.  
* Boundaries support emotional continuity.  
* Stability deepens awareness.

---

### **4\. Required Prompts (Adaptive)**
