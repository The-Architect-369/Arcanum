# Grade I — Audit & Validation Canon
## **Audit & Validation Canon**

**Status:** Canonical · Internal · Enforceable

This document is the sole authoritative definition of how **Grade I — The Guardian** is audited, validated, and protected against drift. It consolidates all integrity logic, sampling methods, violation handling, and governance intervention rules.

Once sealed, this file replaces all prior Guardian audit and validation documents.

---

**I. Purpose of Audit & Validation**

Audit within the Guardian exists to ensure that:

* Structural law is never violated  
* Ethical boundaries are enforced  
* Functional Outcomes remain producible  
* Procedural variation does not cause drift

Audit protects the **human**, the **system**, and the **future Grades**.

---

**II. Audit Philosophy**

The Guardian is audited by **constraint and coverage**, not by subjective quality.

If:

* Structure is intact  
* Agreements are enforced  
* Outcomes are reachable

Then stylistic variation is permitted.

Audit does not evaluate performance, merit, or worth.

---

## **III. Audit Layers (Four-Tier Model)**

### **Layer 1 — Structural Integrity**

Verifies that every generated or authored instance conforms to Guardian law.

**Required Checks:**

* Grade is Guardian only  
* Valid Class ID (1–10)  
* Valid Chapter order (Moon → Mars → Mercury → Venus → Saturn → Sun)  
* Elemental order is preserved  
* Water is final

**Failure Result:** Generation halts.

---

### **Layer 2 — Agreement Enforcement**

Ensures Internal Agreements cannot be bypassed.

**Required Checks:**

* Exactly one primary Internal Agreement per Chapter  
* Agreement aligns with Planetary Chapter  
* No conflicting agreement signals

**Failure Result:** Instance invalidated.

### **Layer 3 — Constraint Compliance**

Validates ethical and behavioral boundaries.

**Disallowed Patterns:**

* Power escalation or authority framing  
* Comparison or ranking  
* Praise, validation loops, or urgency  
* Streak pressure or acceleration  
* Promises of transformation

**Planetary Constraints:**

* Moon: no output demand  
* Mars: no aggression or intensity framing  
* Mercury: no abstraction-only tasks  
* Venus: no comparative valuation  
* Saturn: limits enforced, not optional  
* Sun: integration without climax

**Failure Result:** Instance rejected and logged.

---

### **Layer 4 — Outcome Coverage**

Ensures the system produces Guardian reliability over time.

**Aggregate Checks:**

* All Functional Outcomes are exercised  
* All Internal Agreements recur  
* No outcome or agreement is starved or overrepresented

**Failure Result:** Generator tuning required.

## **IV. Sampling & Replay**

Audit is performed through sampling, not full review.

### **A. Deterministic Replay**

* Every instance records a generation seed  
* Seeds allow exact regeneration

### **B. Random Sampling**

* Samples drawn across:  
  * Classes  
  * Chapters  
  * Elements  
  * Time of day / week

### **C. Edge-Case Sampling**

* First-time practitioners  
* Return after pause  
* Low-energy self-report  
* Maximum repetition cases

---

## **V. Metrics & Signals**

The system tracks:

* Functional Outcome coverage  
* Agreement enforcement frequency  
* Rest-to-effort ratios  
* Time-to-completion ranges  
* Pause and return patterns

Metrics inform system tuning, not individual judgment.

---

## 

## **VI. Human Review Triggers**

Human review is required only if:

* Structural violations exceed tolerance  
* Constraint violations recur  
* Coverage imbalance persists  
* Practitioner harm signals appear

Review targets **systems**, not practitioners.

---

## **VII. Governance Intervention Rules**

Governance may:

* Pause generators  
* Roll back generator versions  
* Require corrective updates

Governance may NOT:

* Alter Functional Outcomes  
* Override Internal Agreements  
* Accelerate progression

---

## **VIII. Canonical Assertion**

If a Guardian instance passes this audit canon, it is considered:

* Structurally valid  
* Ethically bounded  
* Functionally aligned

No further approval is required.
