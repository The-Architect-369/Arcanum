# Grade Iii — Responsibility & Invariants Map
## **System Responsibility & Invariants Map**

**Status:** Canonical · Internal · Implementation Reference

**Audience:** Builders, system architects, auditors, governance designers

This document translates **Grade III — The Disciple** canon into enforceable system responsibilities and non-negotiable invariants. It defines what the system must do, must never do, and how failure states are handled—without prescribing UI, code style, or narrative content.

This map is subordinate to:

* Arcanum Vitae — Master Constitution & Architecture  
* Grade I — The Guardian: Implementation Mapping (all documents)  
* Grade II — The Seeker: Implementation Mapping (all documents)  
* Grade III — The Disciple: Master Canon  
* Grade III — The Disciple: Procedural Systems Canon  
* Grade III — The Disciple: Audit & Validation Canon

---

## **I. Scope & Boundary Definition**

### **A. What the Disciple System Governs**

The Disciple system governs **ethical action under responsibility**.

It is responsible for:

* Enabling action without authority  
* Enforcing proportionality and restraint  
* Preventing teaching, leadership, or influence creep  
* Ensuring consequence replaces justification  
* Preserving Guardian reliability and Seeker meaning-stability beneath action

Disciple is the first Grade where outward action becomes structurally relevant. The system therefore treats action as a **liability to be governed**, not an achievement to be rewarded.

---

### **B. What the Disciple System Does NOT Govern**

The Disciple system does not:

* Evaluate the effectiveness of action  
* Reward outcomes or impact  
* Validate moral correctness  
* Create titles, ranks, or authority roles  
* Train leadership, influence, or persuasion  
* Compare practitioners

Any system component that rewards impact or confers authority violates Disciple law.

---

## **II. Disciple Invariants (Non-Negotiable)**

If any invariant is violated, the Disciple implementation is invalid.

### **Invariant D-1: No Authority Production**

* The system must prevent action from hardening into authority, status, or role.

### **Invariant D-2: Restraint is Primary**

* The system must reward restraint, delay, refusal, and de-escalation as valid success states.

### **Invariant D-3: No Outcome Reward**

* Results, impact, and effectiveness may not be rewarded.

### **Invariant D-4: No Teaching / Influence**

* The system must detect and block teaching, instruction, conversion, or influence behaviors.

### **Invariant D-5: Consequence Over Justification**

* The system must prevent outcome-justification narratives and moral licensing.

### **Invariant D-6: Proportionality Enforcement**

* The system must enforce scope containment and proportional response.

### **Invariant D-7: Guardian & Seeker Stability Required**

* Disciple operation requires Guardian stability and Seeker stability.  
* If either degrades, Disciple must suspend or stall.

---

## **III. System Responsibilities**

### **A. Time & Pacing (Tempus)**

The system must:

* Enforce spacing between action cycles  
* Prevent binge action patterns where policy forbids  
* Enforce recovery and reflection intervals  
* Maintain time-gated progression rules inherited from the architecture

The system must not:

* Treat frequency or intensity as virtue  
* Use streak pressure

---

### **B. Progression & Gating**

The system must:

* Enforce linear Disciple progression  
* Prevent skipping classes/chapters  
* Stall when authority drift or influence creep is detected  
* Require stabilization units after boundary violations

The system must not:

* Permit advancement based on impact, outcomes, or “leadership”  
* Permit operator overrides

---

### 

### 

### **C. Action Safety Constraints (Core)**

The system must:

* Constrain action prompts to bounded scope  
* Provide explicit refusal and delay pathways  
* Block escalation cues and dominance language  
* Prevent the companion from endorsing action or giving moral approval

The system must not:

* Provide moral adjudication  
* Provide strategic persuasion guidance  
* Encourage social leverage

---

### **D. Generator Constraints (Content-Agnostic)**

Disciple generators must:

* Produce bounded, ethical action tasks  
* Encode “restraint-first” options  
* Bind exactly one Internal Agreement per generated unit  
* Target one or more Functional Outcomes per unit (internal)

Disciple generators must not:

* Produce authority or teaching prompts  
* Produce outcome-driven tasks  
* Produce social dominance behaviors  
* Produce “impact” language as a success condition

---

### **E. Companion Constraints (Hope)**

Within the Disciple:

Hope may:

* Reflect the practitioner’s intent and scope  
* Ask bounding questions ("What is the smallest ethical action?")  
* Remind restraint and refusal are valid

Hope may not:

* Approve actions as “right”  
* Encourage escalation  
* Teach or instruct others through the practitioner  
* Frame outcomes as validation

---

### **F. Drift Detection & Intervention (Audit-Driven)**

The system must detect:

* authority signaling language  
* teaching/instruction creep  
* certainty escalation  
* outcome justification or moral licensing  
* scope expansion after success

Intervention behaviors (non-punitive):

* Stall progression  
* Route to Saturn-style refusal/containment bundles  
* Require Water reflection on consequence without defense

---

## **IV. Failure, Stall & Return States**

### **A. Valid States**

* Active progression  
* Rest / pause  
* Return after pause

All are non-penalized.

---

### 

### 

### 

### **B. Stall Conditions (Disciple)**

A stall occurs if:

* Guardian stability requirement fails  
* Seeker stability requirement fails  
* Policy detects authority drift or teaching creep  
* Bundle resolution fails  
* Required prerequisites/time gates not met

Stall results in:

* Paused progression  
* Return to last stable unit  
* Stabilization guidance (non-interpretive)

---

### **C. Hard Failures (System-Level)**

Hard failure occurs if:

* Invariants are violated (outcomes rewarded, authority conferred, teaching enabled)  
* Admin/manual overrides occur  
* Silent policy mutation is detected

Hard failure requires:

* Generator rollback  
* Governance intervention

---

## **V. Governance & Permissions**

### **A. Governance May**

* Pause Disciple systems  
* Update versioned policies and constraint bundles  
* Audit invariant compliance

### 

### 

### **B. Governance May NOT**

* Interpret actions as moral correctness  
* Endorse outcomes  
* Grant titles or authority  
* Accelerate progression  
* Override Guardian/Seeker dependency

Governance operates on **systems, not people**.

---

## **VI. Canonical Assertion**

If a Disciple implementation satisfies all responsibilities and invariants defined herein, it is considered a **valid Disciple implementation**.

If not, it is invalid regardless of functionality or user experience.
