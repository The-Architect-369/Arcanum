# Elementary School Canon
## **Elementary School Canon (Grades I–IV)**

**Status:** Canonical · Public-Facing Summary with Internal Authority

**Scope:** Grades I–IV (The Guardian, The Seeker, The Disciple, The Mystic)

**Audience:** Practitioners, builders, auditors, and future stewards of the Arcanum

---

## **I. Purpose of the Elementary School**

The Elementary School of the Arcanum Vitae exists to **stabilize the human being**.

Before systems can be governed, before creation can be shaped, and before mastery can be safely explored, the practitioner must become **reliable, coherent, ethical, and grounded**.

Elementary School is not about power acquisition. It is about **structural integrity of the self**.

Completion of the Elementary School indicates that a practitioner:

* can be trusted with themselves  
* can hold ambiguity without collapse  
* can act without authority-seeking  
* can perceive without interpretation

Nothing beyond this point is safe without these foundations.

## **II. Non-Negotiable Principles**

The Elementary School enforces the following principles across all four grades:

1. **Reliability Over Insight**

   * Consistency is valued above revelation.  
2. **Stability Over Intensity**

   * Escalation is treated as risk, not progress.  
3. **Containment Over Expression**

   * What is held matters more than what is displayed.  
4. **Ethics Before Capability**

   * No skill is introduced without constraints.  
5. **Grounding as Law**

   * Ordinary life stability is mandatory.

These principles are enforced procedurally, not narratively.

---

## **III. Grade Progression Overview**

### **Grade I — The Guardian**

**Function:** Self-governance and reliability

The Guardian establishes:

* daily self-regulation  
* non-reactive responsibility  
* continuity without external prompting

The Guardian ensures the practitioner can be trusted to proceed.

---

### 

### 

### **Grade II — The Seeker**

**Function:** Meaning discipline and inquiry stability

The Seeker establishes:

* inquiry without obsession  
* ambiguity without collapse  
* cognition without premature coherence

The Seeker ensures the practitioner can think without self-deception.

---

### **Grade III — The Disciple**

**Function:** Ethical action without authority

The Disciple establishes:

* proportional action  
* restraint and refusal  
* consequence over justification

The Disciple ensures the practitioner can act without domination.

---

### **Grade IV — The Mystic**

**Function:** Perception without interpretation

The Mystic establishes:

* perceptual range with grounding  
* observation without doctrine  
* containment over expansion

The Mystic ensures the practitioner can perceive without destabilization.

---

## 

## **IV. What the Elementary School Does NOT Do**

The Elementary School does not:

* grant authority  
* produce teachers or leaders  
* validate insight as truth  
* reward intensity or novelty  
* provide metaphysical explanations

Any system that produces these outcomes at this stage is invalid.

---

## **V. Completion Criteria**

A practitioner is considered to have completed the Elementary School when:

* all four grades are completed canonically  
* no invariant violations remain unresolved  
* Guardian, Seeker, Disciple, and Mystic dependencies are stable

Completion does not imply superiority. It implies **readiness**.

---

## **VI. Transition to Intermediate School**

Upon completion of the Elementary School:

* the practitioner may enter **Intermediate School (Grades V–VIII)**  
* focus shifts from stabilizing the self to stabilizing systems

No practitioner may bypass the Elementary School. No system may override its constraints.

---

## 

## 

## 

## **VII. Canonical Assertion**

If an implementation:

* enforces the principles and constraints defined herein  
* correctly gates progression through Grades I–IV  
* prevents authority, escalation, and destabilization

Then it is compliant with the **Elementary School Canon**.

If not, it is invalid regardless of outcomes or user experience.
