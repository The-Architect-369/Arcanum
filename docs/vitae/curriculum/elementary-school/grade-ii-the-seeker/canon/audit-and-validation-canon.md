# Grade Ii — Audit & Validation Canon
## **Audit & Validation Canon**

**Status:** Canonical · Internal · Enforceable

This document defines how **Grade II — The Seeker** is audited, validated, and protected against cognitive drift, identity fixation, and premature coherence. It ensures that inquiry remains disciplined, embodied, and ethically bounded.

Once sealed, this file replaces all prior Seeker audit, QA, or integrity documents.

---

**I. Purpose of Seeker Audit & Validation**

Audit within the Seeker exists to ensure that:

* Inquiry does not harden into identity  
* Meaning remains provisional and embodied  
* Curiosity remains disciplined rather than compulsive  
* Procedural systems preserve ambiguity  
* Guardian reliability remains intact beneath inquiry

Audit protects the **mind**, the **system**, and the **transition to discernment**.

---

**II. Audit Philosophy**

The Seeker is audited by **ambiguity preservation and constraint enforcement**, not by correctness of insight.

If:

* Structure is intact  
* Ambiguity is preserved  
* Narratives remain provisional

Then variation is permitted.

Audit does not evaluate insight quality, depth, or originality.

---

## **III. Audit Layers (Four-Tier Model)**

### **Layer 1 — Structural Integrity**

Verifies that all Seeker instances conform to inherited law.

**Required Checks:**

* Grade II only  
* Valid Class ID (1–10)  
* Planetary Chapter order preserved  
* Elemental order preserved  
* Air and Water constraints respected

**Failure Result:** Generation halts.

---

### **Layer 2 — Agreement Enforcement**

Ensures Seeker Internal Agreements cannot be bypassed.

**Required Checks:**

* Exactly one primary Seeker Internal Agreement enforced per Chapter  
* Guardian agreements implicitly active  
* No agreement contradiction or override

**Failure Result:** Instance invalidated.

---

### **Layer 3 — Meaning & Identity Drift Detection**

Detects premature coherence and identity crystallization.

**Disallowed Patterns:**

* Insight framed as truth or authority  
* Repeated narrative stabilization  
* Self-definition through inquiry  
* Language of arrival or completion  
* Comparison of depth or understanding

**Planetary Sensitivity:**

* Moon: no interpretive closure  
* Mars: no aggressive inquiry framing  
* Mercury: no abstraction-only insight  
* Venus: no attachment to meaning  
* Saturn: enforced delay of synthesis  
* Sun: integration without crystallization

**Failure Result:** Instance rejected and logged.

---

**Layer 4 — Outcome Coverage**

Ensures the Seeker produces cognitive stability over time.

**Aggregate Checks:**

* Tolerance for ambiguity exercised  
* Narrative flexibility maintained  
* Inquiry depth without fixation  
* Guardian stability signals preserved

**Failure Result:** Generator tuning required.

---

**IV. Sampling & Replay**

Audit is conducted through sampling and replay.

### **A. Deterministic Replay**

* Each instance records a generation seed  
* Seeds enable exact regeneration

### **B. Random Sampling**

* Samples across Classes, Chapters, Elements, and time

### **C. Edge-Case Sampling**

* Extended inquiry cycles  
* High repetition patterns  
* Return-after-pause cases  
* Identity-language detection

---

## **V. Metrics & Signals**

The system tracks:

* Narrative reuse frequency  
* Insight repetition patterns  
* Rest-to-inquiry balance  
* Pause and return behavior  
* Stability of Guardian metrics

Metrics inform system tuning, not practitioner evaluation.

---

## **VI. Human Review Triggers**

Human review is required only if:

* Identity fixation signals persist  
* Ambiguity collapse recurs  
* Structural violations exceed tolerance  
* Practitioner harm indicators appear

Review targets **procedural systems**, not individuals.

---

## **VII. Governance Intervention Rules**

Governance may:

* Pause Seeker generators  
* Roll back generator versions  
* Require corrective updates

Governance may NOT:

* Define meaning  
* Interpret insights  
* Accelerate progression  
* Override Guardian or Seeker canon

---

## **VIII. Canonical Assertion**

If a Seeker instance passes this audit canon, it is considered:

* Structurally valid  
* Cognitively bounded  
* Ethically aligned

No further approval is required.
