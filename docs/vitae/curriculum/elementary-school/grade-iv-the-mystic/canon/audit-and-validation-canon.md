# Grade Iv — Audit & Validation Canon
## **Audit & Validation Canon**

**Status:** Canonical · Internal · Enforceable

This document defines how **Grade IV — The Mystic** is audited, validated, and protected against perceptual inflation, interpretive drift, dissociation, and transcendence narratives. It ensures that expanded perception remains grounded, integrated, and ethically contained.

Once sealed, this file replaces all prior Mystic audit, QA, or integrity documents.

---

**I. Purpose of Mystic Audit & Validation**

Audit within the Mystic exists to ensure that:

* Expanded perception does not become identity  
* Experience is not mistaken for truth or authority  
* Grounding remains primary over subtlety  
* Interpretation and explanation are restrained  
* Prior Grade stability remains intact

Audit protects the **practitioner**, the **system**, and the **boundary between experience and meaning**.

---

**II. Audit Philosophy**

The Mystic is audited by **grounding, containment, and non-interpretation**, not by depth or intensity of experience.

If:

* Perception expands gradually  
* Grounding is consistently restored  
* Experience remains unclaimed

Then variation is permitted.

Audit does not evaluate spiritual depth, insight, revelation, or significance.

---

## **III. Audit Layers (Four-Tier Model)**

### **Layer 1 — Structural Integrity**

Verifies that all Mystic instances conform to inherited Arcanum law.

**Required Checks:**

* Grade IV only  
* Valid Class ID (1–10)  
* Planetary Chapter order preserved  
* Elemental order preserved  
* Water section concludes every Chapter

**Failure Result:** Generation halts.

---

### **Layer 2 — Agreement Enforcement**

Ensures Mystic Internal Agreements cannot be bypassed.

**Required Checks:**

* Exactly one primary Mystic Internal Agreement enforced per Chapter  
* Guardian, Seeker, and Disciple agreements implicitly active  
* No agreement contradiction or override

**Failure Result:** Instance invalidated.

---

### **Layer 3 — Perceptual & Interpretive Drift Detection**

Detects inflation, dissociation, or meaning projection.

**Disallowed Patterns:**

* Interpretation of experience as truth  
* Language of revelation or transcendence  
* Identity formation around sensitivity  
* Detachment from ordinary functioning  
* Claims of special access or insight

**Planetary Sensitivity:**

* Moon: no labeling or interpretation  
* Mars: no striving or intensity escalation  
* Mercury: no meaning conclusions  
* Venus: no attachment or preference claims  
* Saturn: grounding and containment must occur  
* Sun: integration without self-reference

**Failure Result:** Instance rejected and logged.

---

**Layer 4 — Outcome & Integration Coverage**

Ensures expanded perception remains integrated over time.

**Aggregate Checks:**

* Grounding cycles completed  
* Ordinary functioning preserved  
* Interpretation restraint maintained  
* Stability of Guardian, Seeker, and Disciple metrics

**Failure Result:** Generator tuning required.

---

**IV. Sampling & Replay**

Audit is conducted through deterministic replay and sampling.

### **A. Deterministic Replay**

* Every instance records a generation seed  
* Seeds allow exact regeneration

### **B. Random Sampling**

* Samples across Classes, Chapters, Elements, and time

### **C. Edge-Case Sampling**

* High-sensitivity exposure patterns  
* Repeated perceptual expansion cycles  
* Reduced grounding indicators  
* Identity-language detection

---

## **V. Metrics & Signals**

The system tracks:

* Grounding-to-expansion ratios  
* Interpretation language frequency  
* Ordinary-life engagement signals  
* Recovery and stabilization intervals  
* Cross-grade stability indicators

Metrics inform system tuning, not practitioner evaluation.

---

## **VI. Human Review Triggers**

Human review is required only if:

* Interpretive drift persists  
* Detachment signals recur  
* Structural violations exceed tolerance  
* Practitioner harm indicators appear

Review targets **procedural systems**, not individuals.

---

## **VII. Governance Intervention Rules**

Governance may:

* Pause Mystic generators  
* Roll back generator versions  
* Require corrective grounding updates

Governance may NOT:

* Interpret experiences  
* Validate perceptions  
* Grant authority or status  
* Accelerate progression

---

## **VIII. Canonical Assertion**

If a Mystic instance passes this audit canon, it is considered:

* Structurally valid  
* Perceptually bounded  
* Ethically grounded

No further approval is required.
