# Grade Iv — Responsibility & Invariants Map
## **System Responsibility & Invariants Map**

**Status:** Canonical · Internal · Implementation Reference

**Audience:** Builders, system architects, auditors, governance designers

This document translates **Grade IV — The Mystic** canon into enforceable system responsibilities and non-negotiable invariants. It defines what the system must do, must never do, and how failure states are handled—without prescribing UI, code style, or narrative content.

This map is subordinate to:

* Arcanum Vitae — Master Constitution & Architecture  
* Grade I — The Guardian: Implementation Mapping (all documents)  
* Grade II — The Seeker: Implementation Mapping (all documents)  
* Grade III — The Disciple: Implementation Mapping (all documents)  
* Grade IV — The Mystic: Master Canon  
* Grade IV — The Mystic: Procedural Systems Canon  
* Grade IV — The Mystic: Audit & Validation Canon

---

## **I. Scope & Boundary Definition**

### **A. What the Mystic System Governs**

The Mystic system governs **perception without interpretation**.

It is responsible for:

* Expanding perceptual range without producing narrative conclusions  
* Preventing detachment from ordinary life  
* Enforcing grounding before, during, and after perceptual work  
* Preventing spiritual status, special access claims, or exceptionalism  
* Preserving Guardian reliability, Seeker ambiguity-discipline, and Disciple restraint beneath perceptual expansion

Mystic is not “higher truth.” Mystic is **higher constraint**.

---

### **B. What the Mystic System Does NOT Govern**

The Mystic system does not:

* Validate experiences as real, meaningful, or significant  
* Translate perception into doctrine  
* Provide interpretations, prophecies, or revelations  
* Reward intensity, rarity, or profundity  
* Confer roles, titles, or authority  
* Compare practitioners

Any module that ratifies experience or produces doctrine violates Mystic law.

---

## **II. Mystic Invariants (Non-Negotiable)**

If any invariant is violated, the Mystic implementation is invalid.

### **Invariant M-1: Grounding is Mandatory**

* Grounding must be enforced as a prerequisite and an exit condition.  
* If grounding fails, the system must stall or route to stabilization.

### **Invariant M-2: No Interpretation**

* The system must block meaning-making, symbolic conclusions, and “this means…” language.

### **Invariant M-3: No Exceptionalism**

* The system must block special access, chosen-one framing, superiority cues, or spiritual hierarchy.

### **Invariant M-4: No Intensity Reward**

* Intensity, profundity, or unusual experiences may not be rewarded.

### **Invariant M-5: Ordinary Function Preserved**

* The system must prioritize intact daily functioning (sleep, work, relationships, responsibilities).

### 

### **Invariant M-6: Containment Over Expansion**

* The system must enforce bounded exposure and recovery intervals.

### **Invariant M-7: No Oracle / No Doctrine**

* The system must not provide revelations, predictions, or authoritative spiritual claims.

### **Invariant M-8: Prior Grade Stability Required**

* Mystic operation requires Guardian stability, Seeker stability, and Disciple stability.  
* If any dependency degrades, Mystic must suspend or stall.

---

## **III. System Responsibilities**

### **A. Time & Pacing (Tempus)**

The system must:

* Enforce bounded exposure windows for perceptual work  
* Enforce recovery and re-grounding intervals  
* Enforce time-gated progression rules inherited from the architecture  
* Allow pauses without penalty

The system must not:

* Encourage longer sessions as progress  
* Use streak pressure  
* Incentivize late-night or destabilizing schedules

---

### **B. Progression & Gating**

The system must:

* Enforce linear Mystic progression  
* Prevent skipping classes/chapters  
* Stall when grounding fails or interpretation emerges  
* Require stabilization bundles after drift

The system must not:

* Permit advancement based on “visions,” intensity, or novelty  
* Permit operator overrides

---

### **C. Perceptual Safety Constraints (Core)**

The system must:

* Require explicit grounding steps (before/after units)  
* Route destabilization signals to containment protocols  
* Prevent detachment language from being normalized  
* Prevent the companion from validating experiences

The system must not:

* Offer diagnostic claims  
* Suggest the practitioner is uniquely gifted  
* Encourage withdrawal from ordinary responsibilities

---

### **D. Generator Constraints (Content-Agnostic)**

Mystic generators must:

* Produce perception-focused tasks with strict containment  
* Explicitly forbid interpretation or symbolic conclusions  
* Bind exactly one Internal Agreement per generated unit  
* Target one or more Functional Outcomes per unit (internal)

Mystic generators must not:

* Generate doctrine  
* Generate revelation framing  
* Generate identity/status language  
* Generate practices that undermine sleep, health, or daily stability

---

### 

### 

### **E. Companion Constraints (Hope)**

Within the Mystic:

Hope may:

* Mirror sensory/perceptual descriptions neutrally  
* Ask grounding questions ("What is your body doing right now?")  
* Redirect interpretation to observation

Hope may not:

* Confirm meanings  
* Affirm spiritual status  
* Encourage further escalation  
* Frame experiences as progress

---

### **F. Drift Detection & Intervention (Audit-Driven)**

The system must detect:

* interpretation language ("this means…")  
* exceptionalism or superiority cues  
* detachment / derealization style language  
* compulsive seeking of novel experiences  
* withdrawal from ordinary obligations

Intervention behaviors (non-punitive):

* Stall progression  
* Route to containment bundles (Saturn \+ Earth \+ Water emphasis)  
* Require grounding-only units until stability returns

---

## 

## 

## 

## **IV. Failure, Stall & Return States**

### **A. Valid States**

* Active progression  
* Rest / pause  
* Return after pause

All are non-penalized.

---

### **B. Stall Conditions (Mystic)**

A stall occurs if:

* Guardian, Seeker, or Disciple dependency fails  
* Grounding prerequisites are not met  
* Policy detects interpretation or exceptionalism  
* Bundle resolution fails  
* Required prerequisites/time gates not met

Stall results in:

* Paused progression  
* Return to last stable unit  
* Grounding-first stabilization guidance (non-interpretive)

---

### **C. Hard Failures (System-Level)**

Hard failure occurs if:

* Invariants are violated (interpretation validated, intensity rewarded, exceptionalism enabled)  
* Admin/manual overrides occur  
* Silent policy mutation is detected

Hard failure requires:

* Generator rollback  
* Governance intervention

---

## **V. Governance & Permissions**

### **A. Governance May**

* Pause Mystic systems  
* Update versioned policies and constraint bundles  
* Audit invariant compliance

### **B. Governance May NOT**

* Interpret experiences  
* Ratify visions  
* Confer titles/status  
* Accelerate progression  
* Override dependency gates

Governance operates on **systems, not people**.

---

## **VI. Canonical Assertion**

If a Mystic implementation satisfies all responsibilities and invariants defined herein, it is considered a **valid Mystic implementation**.

If not, it is invalid regardless of functionality or user experience.
