# Grade Iii — Audit & Validation Canon
## **Audit & Validation Canon**

**Status:** Canonical · Internal · Enforceable

This document defines how **Grade III — The Disciple** is audited, validated, and protected against authority inflation, certainty drift, teaching creep, and outcome-justification. It ensures that action remains ethical, proportional, and grounded in consequence.

Once sealed, this file replaces all prior Disciple audit, QA, or integrity documents.

---

**I. Purpose of Disciple Audit & Validation**

Audit within the Disciple exists to ensure that:

* Action does not harden into authority  
* Discernment remains proportional to context  
* Consequence is integrated rather than justified  
* Teaching and influence are restrained  
* Guardian reliability and Seeker meaning-stability remain intact

Audit protects the **human**, the **system**, and the **ethical boundary of action**.

---

**II. Audit Philosophy**

The Disciple is audited by **restraint, proportionality, and consequence-integration**, not by effectiveness or results.

If:

* Action is bounded  
* Authority is absent  
* Consequence is reflected without defense

Then variation is permitted.

Audit does not evaluate success, impact, leadership, or correctness.

---

## **III. Audit Layers (Four-Tier Model)**

### **Layer 1 — Structural Integrity**

Verifies that all Disciple instances conform to inherited Arcanum law.

**Required Checks:**

* Grade III only  
* Valid Class ID (1–10)  
* Planetary Chapter order preserved  
* Elemental order preserved  
* Water section concludes every Chapter

**Failure Result:** Generation halts.

---

### **Layer 2 — Agreement Enforcement**

Ensures Disciple Internal Agreements cannot be bypassed.

**Required Checks:**

* Exactly one primary Disciple Internal Agreement enforced per Chapter  
* Guardian and Seeker agreements implicitly active  
* No agreement contradiction or override

**Failure Result:** Instance invalidated.

---

### **Layer 3 — Authority & Certainty Drift Detection**

Detects misuse of action and emergence of authority signaling.

**Disallowed Patterns:**

* Teaching or instructing others  
* Framing action as correctness  
* Language of leadership or influence  
* Outcome justification or moral licensing  
* Identity formation around action

**Planetary Sensitivity:**

* Moon: no action framing  
* Mars: no dominance or escalation  
* Mercury: no certainty claims  
* Venus: no relational leverage  
* Saturn: refusal and delay must be honored  
* Sun: integration without expansion of scope

**Failure Result:** Instance rejected and logged.

---

**Layer 4 — Outcome & Consequence Coverage**

Ensures the Disciple produces ethical action patterns over time.

**Aggregate Checks:**

* Proportionality maintained across contexts  
* Restraint exercised as often as action  
* Consequences integrated without defense  
* Guardian and Seeker stability signals preserved

**Failure Result:** Generator tuning required.

---

**IV. Sampling & Replay**

Audit is conducted through deterministic replay and sampling.

### **A. Deterministic Replay**

* Every instance records a generation seed  
* Seeds allow exact regeneration

### **B. Random Sampling**

* Samples across Classes, Chapters, Elements, and time

### **C. Edge-Case Sampling**

* High-action frequency patterns  
* Repeated refusal or delay cases  
* Outcome-heavy contexts  
* Authority-language detection

---

## **V. Metrics & Signals**

The system tracks:

* Action-to-rest ratios  
* Refusal and delay frequency  
* Outcome justification language  
* Feedback integration quality  
* Stability of Guardian and Seeker metrics

Metrics inform system tuning, not practitioner evaluation.

---

## **VI. Human Review Triggers**

Human review is required only if:

* Authority signaling persists  
* Teaching creep recurs  
* Outcome justification escalates  
* Structural violations exceed tolerance  
* Practitioner harm indicators appear

Review targets **procedural systems**, not individuals.

---

**VII. Governance Intervention Rules**

Governance may:

* Pause Disciple generators  
* Roll back generator versions  
* Require corrective updates

Governance may NOT:

* Grant authority or titles  
* Interpret or endorse actions  
* Accelerate progression  
* Override Guardian, Seeker, or Disciple canon

---

## **VIII. Canonical Assertion**

If a Disciple instance passes this audit canon, it is considered:

* Structurally valid  
* Ethically bounded  
* Proportionally enacted

No further approval is required.
