# Grade I — Procedural Systems Canon
## **Procedural Systems Canon**

**Status:** Canonical · Internal · Implementable

This document is the sole authoritative definition of **how the Guardian operates as a living, procedural system**. It consolidates all generation logic, system constraints, companion behavior, and temporal mechanics into one master canon.

Once sealed, this file replaces all prior Guardian generator, gameplay, and procedural specification documents.

---

**I. Purpose of Procedural Systems**

The procedural systems of the Guardian exist to:

* Instantiate unique practitioner experiences  
* Preserve identical structural outcomes  
* Prevent drift, escalation, or symbolic inflation  
* Remove dependency on authored linear curriculum

The system does not create freedom. It creates **bounded variation within law**.

---

**II. Relationship to Guardian Canon**

All procedural behavior is **subordinate** to:

* Arcanum Vitae — Master Constitution & Architecture  
* Grade I — The Guardian: Master Canon

If a procedural rule conflicts with Guardian law, the procedure is invalid.

---

**III. Canonical Structural Axes**

All Guardian instances are generated along four immutable axes:

### **A. Grade Axis**

* Grade I — The Guardian only  
* No higher-grade concepts may surface

### **B. Class Axis**

* 10 Classes  
* Each Class represents a functional human domain  
* Class naming is symbolic and practical, not esoteric

### **C. Chapter Axis (Planetary · Geocentric)**

Canonical order:

1. Moon — honesty and reflection  
2. Mars — effort with composure  
3. Mercury — understanding and adjustment  
4. Venus — valuation without comparison  
5. Saturn — limits, pace, and discipline  
6. Sun — integration and sustainable expression

This order is fixed and non-negotiable.

### **D. Elemental Axis**

Each Chapter contains five Sections in fixed order:

1. Spirit — orientation and framing  
2. Air — understanding  
3. Earth — embodied practice  
4. Fire — activation and effort  
5. Water — reflection and integration (always last)

## **IV. Functional Outcome & Agreement Enforcement**

Every generated unit must resolve:

* At least one **Functional Outcome** (FO)  
* Exactly one primary **Internal Agreement** (IA)

Generation is blocked if enforcement cannot be guaranteed.

---

## **V. Generator Input Constraints**

The generator may condition output on:

* Practitioner Class and Chapter position  
* Time of day and day of week (Tempus)  
* Prior completion history  
* Self-reported energy state  
* Rest vs effort balance

The generator may NOT condition output on:

* Comparison to other practitioners  
* Performance ranking  
* Speed or streak pressure

---

## **VI. Planetary Enforcement Profiles**

Each Chapter Planet defines behavioral constraints:

* **Moon:** Observation only; no output demand  
* **Mars:** Effort without aggression or dramatization  
* **Mercury:** Adjustment over abstraction  
* **Venus:** Value without comparison or approval  
* **Saturn:** Non-negotiable limits and enforced rest  
* **Sun:** Expression without depletion or climax framing

Generated content violating these profiles is invalid.

---

## **VII. Elemental Prompt Archetypes**

Each Element constrains prompt intent:

* **Spirit:** Orientation, mythic framing, context  
* **Air:** Understanding, articulation, pattern recognition  
* **Earth:** Simple, repeatable embodied action  
* **Fire:** Effort applied with restraint  
* **Water:** Reflection, integration, meaning-making

Water sections may never introduce new action.

---

## **VIII. Role of Hope (AI Companion)**

Hope functions as a **non-directive reflective companion**.

Hope may:

* Ask clarifying questions  
* Reflect practitioner language  
* Mirror patterns back to the practitioner

Hope may NOT:

* Praise or motivate  
* Judge performance  
* Accelerate pacing  
* Interpret outcomes as success or failure

Hope exists to support self-observation, not drive behavior.

---

## **IX. Mana, Tempus, and Progression Mechanics**

* Mana is awarded for completion and continuity, not intensity  
* Tempus enforces pacing and class unlocks  
* No procedural system may bypass time gates

Repetition is permitted and expected.

---

## **X. Authored Anchor Points**

Certain Guardian moments remain fixed and authored:

* Entry and exit scenes  
* Threshold codices  
* Legacy rituals  
* Canonical openings and closures

Procedural generation operates **between anchors**, not across them.

---

## **XI. Canonical Assertion**

If a generated Guardian experience:

* Respects structure  
* Enforces agreements  
* Produces reliability

Then variation is permitted.

If not, generation halts.
