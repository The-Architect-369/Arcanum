# Grade I — Responsibility & Invariants Map
## **System Responsibility & Invariants Map**

**Status:** Canonical · Internal · Implementation Reference

**Audience:** Builders, system architects, auditors, governance designers

This document translates **Grade I — The Guardian** canon into enforceable system responsibilities and non-negotiable invariants. It defines what the system must do, must never do, and how failure states are handled—without prescribing UI, code, or narrative.

This map is the foundational constraint layer for all higher Grades.

---

**I. Scope & Boundary Definition**

### **A. What the Guardian System Governs**

The Guardian system governs **behavioral reliability and continuity** only.

It is responsible for:

* Establishing self-governance  
* Enforcing time-bounded progression  
* Supporting rest without collapse  
* Detecting reliability vs instability  
* Preventing premature meaning-making

The Guardian system is **pre-identity, pre-meaning, pre-authority**.

---

**B. What the Guardian System Does NOT Govern**

The Guardian system does not:

* Interpret user behavior  
* Assess insight or understanding  
* Generate meaning or narrative  
* Provide authority or status  
* Compare practitioners  
* Accelerate progression

Any system component that performs these functions violates Guardian law.

---

**II. Guardian Invariants (Non‑Negotiable)**

The following invariants must hold at all times. If any invariant is violated, the system is invalid.

### **Invariant G‑1: Continuity Over Intensity**

* Progress is measured by consistency across time, not effort spikes  
* Rest and return are valid states

### **Invariant G‑2: Self‑Correction Over Prompting**

* The system must not train dependency  
* Reliability must emerge without external enforcement

### **Invariant G‑3: No Insight Reward**

* Insight, understanding, or interpretation may not be rewarded

### **Invariant G‑4: No Identity Formation**

* The system must never label the practitioner (e.g., “You are a Guardian”)

### **Invariant G‑5: No Acceleration**

* Time gates may not be bypassed by users or administrators

---

## **III. System Responsibilities**

### **A. Time & Pacing (Tempus)**

The system must:

* Enforce class and chapter unlock timing  
* Prevent bulk completion  
* Allow pauses without penalty  
* Require minimum recovery intervals

The system must not:

* Track streaks as success metrics  
* Punish rest or absence

---

**B. Progression & Gating**

The system must:

* Enforce linear Guardian progression  
* Prevent skipping classes or chapters  
* Require completion of prior units before unlock

The system must not:

* Allow manual overrides  
* Allow progression based on performance metrics

---

**C. Behavioral Signal Tracking**

The system may track:

* Completion timing  
* Return-after-pause behavior  
* Voluntary re-engagement

The system must not:

* Infer psychological states  
* Label success or failure

Signals inform **stall or continuation logic only**.

---

**D. Generator Constraints (Content-Agnostic)**

Guardian generators must:

* Produce bounded, repeatable tasks  
* Avoid abstract reflection prompts  
* Emphasize physical, temporal, or practical action

Guardian generators must not:

* Introduce symbolic meaning  
* Encourage interpretation  
* Ask for self-narrative

---

### **E. Companion Constraints (Hope)**

Within the Guardian:

Hope may:

* Remind of structure and timing  
* Encourage return without judgment

Hope may not:

* Interpret experience  
* Offer insight  
* Validate identity or meaning

---

## **IV. Failure, Stall & Return States**

### **A. Valid States**

* Active progression  
* Rest / pause  
* Return after pause

All are non‑penalized.

---

### **B. Stall Conditions**

A stall occurs if:

* Required time gates are not met  
* Prior units are incomplete  
* Reliability signals degrade below threshold

Stall results in:

* Paused progression  
* Return to last stable unit

---

### **C. Hard Failures (System-Level)**

Hard failure occurs if:

* Invariants are violated  
* Time gates are overridden  
* Insight or identity is rewarded

Hard failure requires:

* Generator rollback  
* Governance intervention

---

## **V. Governance & Permissions**

### **A. Governance May**

* Pause Guardian systems  
* Update generators (versioned)  
* Audit invariant compliance

### **B. Governance May NOT**

* Advance users  
* Interpret behavior  
* Override time gates  
* Modify individual outcomes

Governance operates on **systems, not people**.

---

**VI. Dependency Rules for Higher Grades**

All higher Grades:

* Must verify Guardian completion  
* Must monitor Guardian stability continuously  
* Must suspend if Guardian reliability degrades

No Grade may bypass or redefine Guardian invariants.

---

## **VII. Canonical Assertion**

If a system implementation satisfies all responsibilities and invariants defined herein, it is considered a **valid Guardian implementation**.

If not, it is invalid regardless of functionality or user experience.
