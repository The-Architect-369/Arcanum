# The Necromancer Procedural Systems Canon
## **Procedural Systems Canon**

**Status:** Canonical · Internal · Specialization Layer

**Role:** Endings Stewardship · Decay & Release Ethics

**Audience:** Implementers, Architects, Stewards, Auditors

**Transparency Note:** Some previously uploaded specialization reference PDFs may have expired in this environment (expected system behavior). This Procedural Systems Canon is self-contained and does not depend on those files. They may be re-uploaded later for language alignment or functional outcome extraction if desired.

This document defines the **procedural mechanisms** by which the Necromancer specialization operates within the Arcanum runtime. It specifies workflows, gates, and enforcement behaviors aligned with the Necromancer Master Canon and System Responsibilities.

This canon is subordinate to:

* Arcanum Vitae — Master Constitution & Architecture  
* Arcanum Vitae — Specialization-Wide Invariants Canon  
* Arcanum Vitae — Cross-Specialization & Mastery Path Governance Canon  
* The Necromancer — Master Canon  
* The Necromancer — System Responsibilities & Invariants Canon

---

## **I. Entry Procedure**

### **NP-1 — Eligibility Verification**

Prior to activation, the system verifies:

* Core Vitae completion,  
* absence of unresolved nihilism, domination, or taboo-authority violations,  
* demonstrated emotional resilience and capacity for grief engagement.

Failure results in deferred entry.

---

### **NP-2 — Orientation Disclosure**

On entry, the system presents:

* explicit non-claims (no power, no authority through death),  
* risk disclosures (nihilism, morbidity, emotional overwhelm),  
* consent, pacing, and reversibility guarantees,  
* exit assurances.

User acknowledgment is required.

---

## **II. Recognition & Containment Workflow**

### **NP-3 — Endings Recognition**

The system supports recognition of:

* identity dissolution,  
* relationship endings,  
* lifecycle completions,  
* obsolete structures or narratives.

Recognition is descriptive, not directive.

---

### **NP-4 — Containment & Care**

When endings are identified, the system:

* provides emotional containment prompts,  
* emphasizes care over catharsis,  
* discourages dramatic or performative release.

---

## 

## 

## 

## **III. Release & Composting Workflow**

### **NP-5 — Consent-Gated Release**

Release practices require:

* explicit, revocable consent,  
* readiness self-assessment,  
* acknowledgment of potential emotional impact.

---

### **NP-6 — Pacing Enforcement**

The system enforces pacing by:

* slowing or pausing release during destabilization,  
* encouraging rest and integration between stages,  
* honoring hesitation as meaningful data.

---

### **NP-7 — Composting & Renewal Framing**

The system frames decay as:

* transformation rather than erasure,  
* fertile ground for future emergence,  
* non-instrumental and non-teleological.

No promised outcomes are attached.

---

## **IV. Safeguard Enforcement**

### **NP-8 — Nihilism Detection**

The system monitors for:

* meaning-erasing language,  
* hopeless framing,  
* collapse into emptiness.

Detection triggers meaning-preservation reframing.

---

### **NP-9 — Morbid Fixation Control**

If attention fixates on death or loss:

* balance prompts are introduced,  
* life-affirming context is reintroduced,  
* cross-specialization support is suggested.

---

### **NP-10 — Authority Suppression**

If engagement with taboo implies superiority:

* humility framing is enforced,  
* outputs are softened or blocked,  
* repeated violations trigger stall.

---

## **V. Cross-Specialization Interaction**

### **NP-11 — Deference Protocols**

The Necromancer system must defer:

* ecological decay processes to the **Druid**,  
* liminal pacing to the **Hierophant**,  
* coherence restraint to the **Philosopher**,  
* distortion checks to the **Illusionist**,  
* transformative synthesis to the **Alchemist**.

---

**NP-12 — Dialogical Interface**

All Necromancer outputs must be framed as:

* observations,  
* invitations to release,  
* compassionate reflections.

Commands, prescriptions, or fatalistic claims are prohibited.

---

## **VI. Audit & Logging**

### **NP-13 — Event Logging**

The system logs:

* endings recognitions,  
* consent verifications,  
* pacing interventions,  
* grief-support prompts,  
* exits and pauses.

Logs are immutable and auditable.

---

## **VII. Exit & Pause Procedures**

### **NP-14 — Voluntary Exit**

Practitioners may pause or exit Necromancer practice at any time.

The system ensures:

* clean disengagement,  
* no penalty,  
* no loss of standing.

---

## **VIII. Failure Handling**

### **NP-15 — Protective Stall**

Upon repeated invariant violations, the system:

* stalls Necromancer functions,  
* issues corrective guidance,  
* requires re-orientation prior to resumption.

---

## **IX. Canonical Assertion**

If Necromancer procedures enable nihilism, domination, or taboo-based authority, they are invalid.

The procedural system exists to steward endings as compassionate, ethical transitions that sustain life.
