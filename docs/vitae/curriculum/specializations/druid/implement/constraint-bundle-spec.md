# The Druid Constraint Bundle Spec
## **Constraint Bundle Specification**

**Status:** Canonical · Internal · Implementation Reference

**Audience:** Builders, system architects, implementers, auditors

**Transparency Note:** Some previously uploaded reference PDFs/files have expired in this environment (expected system behavior). This specification is derived entirely from the **locked Druid canons** and the Generator & Module Mapping created in-session. If alignment against older drafts is desired, please re-upload those references.

This document defines the **constraint bundles** used by the generator to produce valid Druid specialization units. Constraint bundles ensure ecological coherence, reciprocity, and care **without domination, extraction, or instrumentalization**.

This specification is subordinate to:

* Arcanum Vitae — Master Constitution & Architecture  
* Arcanum Vitae — Specialization Overview Codex  
* Arcanum Vitae — Cross-Specialization Mastery Paths Canon  
* The Druid — Master Canon  
* The Druid — System Responsibilities & Invariants Canon  
* The Druid — Procedural Systems Canon  
* The Druid — Generator & Module Mapping

## **I. Constraint Bundle Purpose**

A **Druid Constraint Bundle (DCB)** is a deterministic, immutable set of constraints resolved at generation-time. Every Generated Unit (SGU) must bind to **exactly one** DCB.

The DCB ensures that:

* ecological relationships are engaged without control,  
* reciprocity replaces extraction,  
* care is practiced without domination,  
* living systems are honored as autonomous.

---

## **II. Bundle Composition**

Each DCB consists of the following components:

### **A. Ecological / Relational Kernel Set**

* One or more **ecological or relational kernels** (fixed authored content)  
* Kernels must:  
  * frame nature as relational, not instrumental  
  * avoid mastery or ownership narratives  
  * emphasize mutuality and interdependence

---

### **B. Invitational Prompt Grammar**

* Bounded prompt templates that:  
  * invite noticing relationship and impact  
  * avoid instruction to control, alter, or extract  
  * maintain humility and responsiveness

---

### **C. Prohibited Domination & Extraction List**

Explicitly forbidden within any SGU:

* control or command of natural systems  
* mastery or ownership claims  
* extraction for personal gain  
* manipulation of living beings  
* ecological superiority narratives

Any violation invalidates the unit.

---

**D. Internal Agreement (IA) Binding**

* Exactly **one** IA is bound per bundle  
* IA enforces:  
  * reciprocity  
  * care without domination  
  * reversibility and consent

---

### **E. Functional Outcome Targets**

* Each bundle must target **at least one** Druid FO  
* FO targets must describe capacities of relationship, attunement, or stewardship—not achievement or control

---

## **III. Bundle Resolution Rules**

At generation time:

1. SPC relationship axis is read  
2. Applicable ecological kernels are selected  
3. Invitational prompt grammar is instantiated  
4. Prohibited domination/extraction list is enforced  
5. IA and FO targets are attached  
6. Seed is issued and recorded

Failure at any step → bundle rejection → regeneration or stall

---

## **IV. Determinism & Replay**

* Every DCB is identified by a unique `constraint_bundle_id`  
* Bundle resolution is deterministic given:  
  * SPC  
  * kernel versions  
  * policy version  
  * seed

This guarantees full replay and audit reproducibility.

## **V. Violation Handling**

If a Generated Unit violates bundle constraints:

* the unit is rejected  
* regeneration is attempted (bounded retries)  
* repeated failures trigger specialization stall

No human override is permitted.

---

## **VI. Cross-Specialization Safety**

Druid constraint bundles must not:

* grant ecological authority over others  
* collapse into resource optimization or exploitation  
* override specialization-wide invariants

All cross-specialization conflicts defer to the **Policy Engine**.

---

## **VII. Canonical Assertion**

If a constraint bundle permits domination, extraction, or instrumentalization of living systems, it is invalid.

This specification defines the **only valid constraint bundle structure** for the Druid specialization.
