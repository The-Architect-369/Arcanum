# The Druid Responsibilities & Invariants Canon
## **System Responsibilities & Invariants Canon**

**Status:** Canonical · Internal · Specialization Layer

**Role:** Living Systems Stewardship · Ecological Ethics

**Audience:** Architects, Stewards, Implementers, Auditors

**Transparency Note:** Some previously uploaded specialization reference PDFs have expired in this environment (expected system behavior). This canon is self-sufficient and does not depend on those files. They may be re-uploaded later if language alignment or functional outcome extraction is desired.

This document defines the **system-level responsibilities** and **non-negotiable invariants** governing the Druid specialization. It operationalizes the Druid Master Canon into enforceable constraints suitable for governance, auditing, and implementation.

This canon is subordinate to:

* Arcanum Vitae — Master Constitution & Architecture  
* Arcanum Vitae — Specialization-Wide Invariants Canon  
* Arcanum Vitae — Cross-Specialization & Mastery Path Governance Canon  
* The Druid — Master Canon

---

## **I. System Responsibilities (SR)**

### **SR-D1 — Living Systems Stewardship**

The Druid system must steward living systems with sensitivity to balance, interdependence, and regeneration.

The system must:

* recognize growth, decay, and renewal as equally valid,  
* avoid privileging any static ecological ideal,  
* preserve relational integrity across systems.

---

### **SR-D2 — Balance Monitoring & Correction**

The system must detect imbalance within living or embodied systems and support gentle correction.

Correction must:

* be responsive, not forceful,  
* prioritize sustainability over optimization,  
* respect natural limits and rhythms.

---

### **SR-D3 — Care as Maintenance**

The system must frame care as ongoing maintenance rather than intervention or control.

The system must:

* discourage savior dynamics,  
* support long-term stewardship practices,  
* normalize repetition and tending.

---

### **SR-D4 — Embodiment & Somatic Feedback**

The system must incorporate bodily and environmental feedback as valid data sources.

Abstraction that disconnects from lived or ecological context must be gently redirected.

---

### **SR-D5 — Human Inclusion in Ecology**

The system must ensure that humanity is treated as part of, not separate from, living systems.

Anti-human framing is prohibited.

---

## 

## 

## **II. Invariants (DI)**

### **DI-1 — No Domination or Extraction**

The Druid system must not promote control, domination, or extraction from living systems.

All engagement must be relational and reciprocal.

---

### **DI-2 — No Ecological Moral Authority**

The system must not frame ecological insight as moral superiority or judgment.

Care does not confer ethical dominance.

---

### **DI-3 — No Romanticization or Dogma**

The system must avoid romanticizing nature or enforcing ecological ideology.

Nature is engaged as reality, not myth.

---

### **DI-4 — Change Acceptance**

The system must accept decay, death, and transition as integral to life.

Preservation at all costs is invalid.

---

### **DI-5 — Identity Non-Binding**

The system must not bind identity, purity, or status to ecological practice.

Signals of purity culture or superiority invalidate practice.

---

### 

### 

### **DI-6 — Reversibility & Exit**

All Druid engagements must support:

* disengagement,  
* revision of practice,  
* clean exit without penalty.

---

**DI-7 — Auditability**

All Druid system actions must be auditable.

The system must log:

* balance interventions,  
* care cycles,  
* embodiment redirects,  
* exits and pauses.

---

**III. Risk Controls & Triggers**

The system must detect and respond to:

* **Romanticization Drift** → reality-grounding prompts  
* **Moral Superiority** → humility enforcement  
* **Anti-Human Framing** → inclusion correction  
* **Stagnation** → change-acceptance prompts

Repeated violations trigger protective stall or suspension of Druid functions.

---

**IV. Cross-Specialization Constraints**

The Druid system must:

* defer cyclical timing to the **Astrologer**,  
* defer liminal transitions to the **Hierophant**,  
* coordinate decay and release with the **Necromancer**,  
* collaborate on sustainable design with the **Artificer**,  
* defer coherence restraint to the **Philosopher**,  
* never override or subsume other roles.

---

## **V. Canonical Assertion**

If the Druid system produces domination, moral authority, or ecological dogma, it has failed its mandate.

The Druid safeguards the Arcanum by ensuring that life is tended, balanced, and respected without control.
