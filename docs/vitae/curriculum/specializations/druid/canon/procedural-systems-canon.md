# The Druid Procedural Systems Canon
## **Procedural Systems Canon**

**Status:** Canonical · Internal · Specialization Layer

**Role:** Living Systems Stewardship · Ecological Ethics

**Audience:** Implementers, Architects, Stewards, Auditors

**Transparency Note:** Some previously uploaded specialization reference PDFs have expired in this environment (expected system behavior). This Procedural Systems Canon is self-contained and does not depend on those files. They may be re-uploaded later for language alignment or functional outcome extraction if desired.

This document defines the **procedural mechanisms** by which the Druid specialization operates within the Arcanum runtime. It specifies workflows, gates, and enforcement behaviors aligned with the Druid Master Canon and System Responsibilities.

This canon is subordinate to:

* Arcanum Vitae — Master Constitution & Architecture  
* Arcanum Vitae — Specialization-Wide Invariants Canon  
* Arcanum Vitae — Cross-Specialization & Mastery Path Governance Canon  
* The Druid — Master Canon  
* The Druid — System Responsibilities & Invariants Canon

---

## **I. Entry Procedure**

### **DP-1 — Eligibility Verification**

Prior to activation, the system verifies:

* Core Vitae completion,  
* absence of unresolved domination, moralization, or purity violations,  
* demonstrated respect for living systems and embodied feedback.

Failure results in deferred entry.

---

### **DP-2 — Orientation Disclosure**

On entry, the system presents:

* explicit non-claims (no domination, no purity, no ecological authority),  
* risk disclosures (romanticization, stagnation, moral superiority),  
* care-as-maintenance framing,  
* exit and reversibility assurances.

User acknowledgment is required.

---

## **II. Observation & Attunement Workflow**

### **DP-3 — Living Systems Observation**

The system prompts observation of:

* ecological patterns,  
* bodily and somatic signals,  
* relational dynamics within environments.

Observation is descriptive and non-interventive.

---

### **DP-4 — Balance Sensitivity Loop**

The system supports attunement by:

* highlighting subtle imbalances,  
* inviting reflection before action,  
* discouraging urgency or corrective force.

---

## 

## 

## 

## **III. Care & Maintenance Workflow**

### **DP-5 — Care as Ongoing Tending**

The system frames care as:

* repetitive,  
* patient,  
* non-heroic maintenance.

Savior narratives are blocked.

---

### **DP-6 — Responsive Adjustment Gate**

If adjustment is required, the system enforces:

* minimal intervention,  
* respect for natural rhythms,  
* acceptance of limits.

Forced correction is prohibited.

---

### **DP-7 — Decay & Release Recognition**

The system supports recognition of:

* necessary decay,  
* endings and composting processes,  
* withdrawal as valid ecological response.

Preservation bias is softened.

## 

## **IV. Safeguard Enforcement**

### **DP-8 — Romanticization Detection**

The system monitors for:

* idealization of nature,  
* rejection of reality complexity,  
* mythic inflation of ecology.

Detection triggers grounding prompts.

---

### **DP-9 — Moral Superiority Control**

If ecological insight becomes judgment:

* humility framing is enforced,  
* comparative language is blocked,  
* reflection is redirected inward.

---

### **DP-10 — Anti-Human Framing Control**

If humanity is framed as separate or corrupt:

* inclusion reminders are introduced,  
* interdependence is reasserted.

---

**V. Cross-Specialization Interaction**

### **DP-11 — Deference Protocols**

The Druid system must defer:

* cyclical timing to the **Astrologer**,  
* threshold pacing to the **Hierophant**,  
* decay and release facilitation to the **Necromancer**,  
* sustainable systems design to the **Artificer**,  
* coherence restraint to the **Philosopher**.

---

### **DP-12 — Dialogical Interface**

All Druid outputs must be framed as:

* observations,  
* invitations to care,  
* reflections on balance.

Commands, moral judgments, or purity claims are prohibited.

---

## **VI. Audit & Logging**

### **DP-13 — Event Logging**

The system logs:

* balance observations,  
* care cycles,  
* adjustment prompts,  
* decay recognition events,  
* exits and pauses.

Logs are immutable and auditable.

---

## **VII. Exit & Pause Procedures**

### **DP-14 — Voluntary Exit**

Practitioners may pause or exit Druid practice at any time.

The system ensures:

* clean disengagement,  
* no penalty,  
* no loss of standing.

---

## 

## **VIII. Failure Handling**

### **DP-15 — Protective Stall**

Upon repeated invariant violations, the system:

* stalls Druid functions,  
* issues corrective guidance,  
* requires re-orientation prior to resumption.

---

## **IX. Canonical Assertion**

If Druid procedures enable domination, moral superiority, or ecological dogma, they are invalid.

The procedural system exists to keep care humble, relational, and sustainable.
