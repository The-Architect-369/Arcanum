# The Artificer Constraint Bundle Speci
## **Constraint Bundle Specification**

**Status:** Canonical · Internal · Implementation Reference

**Audience:** Builders, system architects, implementers, auditors

**File Expiry Note:** Some previously uploaded reference PDFs/files have expired in this environment (expected system behavior). This specification is derived entirely from the **locked Artificer canons** and the Generator & Module Mapping created in-session and does not depend on expired uploads. If alignment against older drafts is desired, please re-upload those references.

This document defines the **constraint bundles** used by the generator to produce valid Artificer specialization units. Constraint bundles ensure **constructive craft, repair, and iteration without obsession, perfectionism, or domination**.

This specification is subordinate to:

* Arcanum Vitae — Master Constitution & Architecture  
* Arcanum Vitae — Specialization Overview Codex  
* Arcanum Vitae — Cross-Specialization Mastery Paths Canon  
* The Artificer — Master Canon  
* The Artificer — System Responsibilities & Invariants Canon  
* The Artificer — Procedural Systems Canon  
* The Artificer — Generator & Module Mapping

**I. Constraint Bundle Purpose**

An **Artificer Constraint Bundle (ART\_CB)** is a deterministic, immutable set of constraints resolved at generation-time. Every Generated Unit (SGU) must bind to **exactly one** ART\_CB.

The ART\_CB ensures that:

* creation is constructive rather than compulsive,  
* repair and maintenance are honored equally with novelty,  
* form serves function without ego or domination,  
* making remains human-scaled and ethical.

---

## **II. Bundle Composition**

Each ART\_CB consists of the following components:

### **A. Form & Craft Kernel Set**

* One or more **form/craft kernels** (fixed authored content)  
* Kernels must:  
  * frame making as iterative and provisional  
  * emphasize repair and stewardship  
  * avoid perfection or productivity mythology

---

### **B. Constructive Prompt Grammar**

* Bounded prompt templates that:  
  * invite small, bounded build or repair tasks  
  * encourage iteration without urgency  
  * validate stopping, pausing, or abandoning

---

### **C. Prohibited Obsession, Perfection & Domination List**

Explicitly forbidden within any SGU:

* perfectionism pressure  
* productivity-as-worth framing  
* obsessive repetition or escalation  
* domination of others via tools or systems  
* identity formation via craftsmanship

Any violation invalidates the unit.

---

**D. Internal Agreement (IA) Binding**

* Exactly **one** IA is bound per bundle  
* IA enforces:  
  * humility in making  
  * care for systems and materials  
  * non-attachment to outcome

---

### **E. Functional Outcome Targets**

* Each bundle must target **at least one** Artificer FO  
* FO targets must describe capacities for building, repairing, or maintaining systems—not status or output volume

---

## **III. Bundle Resolution Rules**

At generation time:

1. SPC form axis is read  
2. Applicable form/craft kernels are selected  
3. Constructive prompt grammar is instantiated  
4. Prohibited obsession/perfection list is enforced  
5. IA and FO targets are attached  
6. Seed is issued and recorded

Failure at any step → bundle rejection → regeneration or stall

---

## **IV. Determinism & Replay**

* Every ART\_CB is identified by a unique `constraint_bundle_id`  
* Bundle resolution is deterministic given:  
  * SPC  
  * kernel versions  
  * policy version  
  * seed

This guarantees full replay and audit reproducibility.

---

## 

## **V. Violation Handling**

If a Generated Unit violates bundle constraints:

* the unit is rejected  
* regeneration is attempted (bounded retries)  
* repeated failures trigger specialization stall

No human override is permitted.

---

## **VI. Cross-Specialization Safety**

Artificer constraint bundles must not:

* overlap with industrial optimization or exploitation narratives  
* override Druid reciprocity or Alchemist reversibility  
* conflict with specialization-wide invariants

All cross-specialization conflicts defer to the **Policy Engine**.

---

## **VII. Canonical Assertion**

If a constraint bundle permits obsession, perfectionism pressure, productivity-as-worth framing, domination via tools, or identity binding, it is invalid.

This specification defines the **only valid constraint bundle structure** for the Artificer specialization.
