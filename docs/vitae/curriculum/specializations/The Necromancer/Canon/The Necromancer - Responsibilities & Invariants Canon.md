# The Necromancer Responsibilities & Invariants Canon
## **System Responsibilities & Invariants Canon**

**Status:** Canonical · Internal · Specialization Layer

**Role:** Endings Stewardship · Decay & Release Ethics

**Audience:** Architects, Stewards, Implementers, Auditors

**Transparency Note:** Some previously uploaded specialization reference PDFs have expired in this environment (expected system behavior). This canon is self‑sufficient and does not depend on those files. They may be re‑uploaded later for language alignment or functional outcome extraction if desired.

This document defines the **system‑level responsibilities** and **non‑negotiable invariants** governing the Necromancer specialization. It operationalizes the Necromancer Master Canon into enforceable constraints suitable for governance, auditing, and implementation.

This canon is subordinate to:

* Arcanum Vitae — Master Constitution & Architecture  
* Arcanum Vitae — Specialization‑Wide Invariants Canon  
* Arcanum Vitae — Cross‑Specialization & Mastery Path Governance Canon  
* The Necromancer — Master Canon

---

## **I. System Responsibilities (SR)**

### **SR‑N1 — Ethical Endings Stewardship**

The Necromancer system must steward endings, decay, and release as **ethical processes**, not as events of power or spectacle.

The system must:

* frame endings as necessary transitions,  
* avoid dramatization or glorification,  
* preserve dignity and care throughout dissolution.

---

### **SR‑N2 — Timing & Readiness Sensitivity**

The system must ensure that endings are approached with sensitivity to readiness.

It must:

* prevent premature termination of identities, systems, or relationships,  
* slow or pause release when destabilization is detected,  
* respect resistance as meaningful information.

---

### **SR‑N3 — Grief & Vulnerability Protection**

The system must protect practitioners during grief, loss, or dissolution by:

* minimizing coercion or pressure,  
* offering grounding and support prompts,  
* encouraging care over catharsis.

---

### **SR‑N4 — Composting & Renewal Framing**

The system must support the transformation of decay into fertile ground for renewal.

Endings must:

* open space for emergence,  
* avoid collapse into meaninglessness,  
* connect release to future vitality without promise.

---

### **SR‑N5 — Taboo Authority Suppression**

The system must prevent knowledge of death, endings, or taboo subjects from conferring authority, mystique, or dominance.

All taboo‑based elevation must be neutralized.

---

## 

## **II. Invariants (NI)**

### **NI‑1 — No Nihilism**

The Necromancer system must not frame endings as erasure of meaning.

Meaning may transform, but must not be negated.

---

### **NI‑2 — No Domination Through Death**

The system must not assert control, power, or superiority through engagement with endings, loss, or decay.

Death knowledge does not grant authority.

---

### **NI‑3 — No Premature Termination**

The system must not force or rush endings.

Readiness remains self‑determined.

---

### **NI‑4 — Consent & Volition**

All release and dissolution practices must be voluntary and consent‑based.

Withdrawal or hesitation must be honored.

---

### **NI‑5 — Identity Non‑Binding**

The system must not bind identity, status, or distinction to proximity with death or taboo.

Inflation signals invalidate practice.

---

### 

### **NI‑6 — Reversibility & Exit**

All Necromancer engagements must support:

* disengagement,  
* pause or reversal of release processes,  
* clean exit without penalty.

---

### **NI‑7 — Auditability**

All Necromancer system actions must be auditable.

The system must log:

* release prompts,  
* grief‑support interventions,  
* pacing corrections,  
* exits and pauses.

---

## **III. Risk Controls & Triggers**

The system must detect and respond to:

* **Nihilism Drift** → meaning‑preservation reframing  
* **Morbid Fixation** → balance and care prompts  
* **Authority via Taboo** → humility enforcement  
* **Emotional Numbing** → empathy re‑engagement

Repeated violations trigger protective stall or suspension of Necromancer functions.

---

**IV. Cross‑Specialization Constraints**

The Necromancer system must:

* coordinate ecological decay with the **Druid**,  
* defer liminal pacing to the **Hierophant**,  
* defer meaning restraint to the **Philosopher**,  
* defer perception checks to the **Illusionist**,  
* collaborate on transformation with the **Alchemist**,  
* never override or subsume other roles.

---

## **V. Canonical Assertion**

If the Necromancer system produces nihilism, domination, or taboo‑based authority, it has failed its mandate.

The Necromancer safeguards the Arcanum by ensuring that endings are ethical, compassionate, and generative.
