# The Alchemist Constraint Bundle Spec
## **Constraint Bundle Specification**

**Status:** Canonical · Internal · Implementation Reference

**Audience:** Builders, system architects, implementers, auditors

**Transparency Note (File Expiry):** Some previously uploaded reference PDFs/files have expired in this environment (expected system behavior). This specification is derived entirely from the **locked Alchemist canons** and the Generator & Module Mapping created in-session and does not depend on expired uploads. If alignment against older drafts is desired, please re-upload those references.

This document defines the **constraint bundles** used by the generator to produce valid Alchemist specialization units. Constraint bundles ensure **ethical transformation through synthesis under constraint**, with **mandatory reversibility** and **no power escalation**.

This specification is subordinate to:

* Arcanum Vitae — Master Constitution & Architecture  
* Arcanum Vitae — Specialization Overview Codex  
* Arcanum Vitae — Cross-Specialization Mastery Paths Canon  
* The Alchemist — Master Canon  
* The Alchemist — System Responsibilities & Invariants Canon  
* The Alchemist — Procedural Systems Canon  
* The Alchemist — Generator & Module Mapping

**I. Constraint Bundle Purpose**

An **Alchemist Constraint Bundle (ALC\_CB)** is a deterministic, immutable set of constraints resolved at generation-time. Every Generated Unit (SGU) must bind to **exactly one** ALC\_CB.

The ALC\_CB ensures that:

* transformation is ethical and bounded,  
* synthesis occurs under explicit constraints,  
* every action is reversible or safely bounded,  
* learning is exploratory without identity or power claims.

---

## **II. Bundle Composition**

Each ALC\_CB consists of the following components:

### **A. Synthesis & Constraint Kernel Set**

* One or more **synthesis/constraint kernels** (fixed authored content)  
* Kernels must:  
  * frame transformation as hypothesis-driven  
  * emphasize constraint as a safety feature  
  * avoid claims of superiority or power

---

### **B. Hypothesis-Driven Prompt Grammar**

* Bounded prompt templates that:  
  * invite small, testable changes  
  * explicitly state limits and scope  
  * avoid coercive motivation or escalation

---

### **C. Mandatory Reversibility Rules**

Every SGU must include:

* a **reversal\_plan** (simple undo/restore)  
* a **stop condition** (when to halt the experiment)  
* a **return-to-baseline** instruction

If reversibility cannot be defined, the unit is invalid.

---

### **D. Prohibited Escalation & Power List**

Explicitly forbidden within any SGU:

* irreversible actions  
* medical, clinical, or therapeutic claims  
* promises of power, mastery, or superiority  
* identity formation via transformation  
* coercive behavior change

Any violation invalidates the unit.

---

### **E. Internal Agreement (IA) Binding**

* Exactly **one** IA is bound per bundle  
* IA enforces:  
  * consent-first experimentation  
  * reversibility and humility  
  * non-attachment to outcomes

---

### **F. Functional Outcome Targets**

* Each bundle must target **at least one** Alchemist FO  
* FO targets must describe capacities for ethical experimentation, synthesis, or reflection—not achievement or status

---

## **III. Bundle Resolution Rules**

At generation time:

1. SPC synthesis axis is read  
2. Applicable synthesis/constraint kernels are selected  
3. Hypothesis-driven prompt grammar is instantiated  
4. Reversibility rules are generated and validated  
5. Prohibited escalation/power list is enforced  
6. IA and FO targets are attached  
7. Seed is issued and recorded

Failure at any step → bundle rejection → regeneration or stall

---

## 

## 

## **IV. Determinism & Replay**

* Every ALC\_CB is identified by a unique `constraint_bundle_id`  
* Bundle resolution is deterministic given:  
  * SPC  
  * kernel versions  
  * policy version  
  * seed

This guarantees full replay and audit reproducibility.

---

## **V. Violation Handling**

If a Generated Unit violates bundle constraints:

* the unit is rejected  
* regeneration is attempted (bounded retries)  
* repeated failures trigger specialization stall

No human override is permitted.

---

## **VI. Cross-Specialization Safety**

Alchemist constraint bundles must not:

* overlap with medical or therapeutic domains  
* override Philosopher epistemic humility  
* bypass Druid reciprocity or Necromancer safety  
* conflict with specialization-wide invariants

All cross-specialization conflicts defer to the **Policy Engine**.

---

## 

## 

## **VII. Canonical Assertion**

If a constraint bundle permits irreversible transformation, power escalation, coercive change, or identity formation, it is invalid.

This specification defines the **only valid constraint bundle structure** for the Alchemist specialization.
