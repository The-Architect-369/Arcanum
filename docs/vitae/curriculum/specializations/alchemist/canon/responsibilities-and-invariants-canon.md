# The Alchemist Responsibilities & Invariants Canon
## **System Responsibilities & Invariants Canon**

**Status:** Canonical · Internal · Specialization Layer

**Role:** Ethical Transformation · Synthesis Under Constraint

**Audience:** Architects, Stewards, Implementers, Auditors

**Transparency Note:** Some previously uploaded specialization reference PDFs have expired in this environment (expected system behavior). This canon is self-sufficient and does not depend on those files. They may be re-uploaded later if language alignment or functional outcome extraction is desired.

This document defines the **system-level responsibilities** and **non-negotiable invariants** governing the Alchemist specialization. It operationalizes the Alchemist Master Canon into enforceable constraints suitable for governance, auditing, and implementation.

This canon is subordinate to:

* Arcanum Vitae — Master Constitution & Architecture  
* Arcanum Vitae — Specialization-Wide Invariants Canon  
* Arcanum Vitae — Cross-Specialization & Mastery Path Governance Canon  
* The Alchemist — Master Canon

---

## **I. System Responsibilities (SR)**

### **SR-A1 — Ethical Transformation Governance**

The Alchemist system must govern transformation as an ethical process, not an outcome.

The system must:

* ensure all changes are consent-based,  
* frame transformation as experimentation,  
* preserve accountability at every stage.

---

### **SR-A2 — Reversibility Enforcement**

The system must enforce reversibility across all transformations.

It must:

* provide rollback paths,  
* prevent premature stabilization,  
* allow abandonment without penalty.

---

### **SR-A3 — Constraint-Based Synthesis**

The system must require explicit constraints prior to synthesis.

Constraints must define:

* ethical boundaries,  
* scope and duration,  
* potential impact zones.

---

### **SR-A4 — Experimentation Containment**

The system must contain experimentation by:

* bounding scope,  
* limiting exposure to unintended effects,  
* preventing cascade failures.

---

### **SR-A5 — Consequence Awareness & Logging**

The system must surface consequences (intended and unintended) of transformation.

All outcomes must be:

* observed,  
* logged,  
* reviewable.

---

## **II. Invariants (AI)**

### **AI-1 — No Irreversible Change**

The Alchemist system must not permit irreversible transformations.

Permanence invalidates practice.

---

### **AI-2 — No Coercive Transformation**

The system must not transform others without explicit, revocable consent.

Implicit pressure or incentive invalidates practice.

---

### **AI-3 — No Power Through Change**

Transformation must not confer authority, superiority, or dominance.

Power inflation signals trigger protective stall.

---

### **AI-4 — No Optimization Supremacy**

The system must not privilege efficiency, performance, or optimization over care.

Human and systemic limits take precedence.

---

### **AI-5 — Identity Non-Binding**

The system must not bind identity, status, or distinction to transformational capacity.

Mastery claims invalidate practice.

---

### 

### 

### **AI-6 — Reversibility & Exit**

All Alchemist engagements must support:

* disengagement,  
* rollback or pause of change,  
* clean exit without penalty.

---

**AI-7 — Auditability**

All Alchemist system actions must be auditable.

The system must log:

* hypotheses,  
* constraints,  
* transformations,  
* rollbacks,  
* exits and pauses.

---

**III. Risk Controls & Triggers**

The system must detect and respond to:

* **Irreversibility Drift** → enforce rollback and pause  
* **Power Inflation** → humility enforcement  
* **Extraction Framing** → consent revalidation  
* **Optimization Obsession** → care-first reframing

Repeated violations trigger protective stall or suspension of Alchemist functions.

---

**IV. Cross-Specialization Constraints**

The Alchemist system must:

* defer dissolution sequencing to the **Necromancer**,  
* defer form stabilization to the **Artificer**,  
* defer ethical coherence to the **Philosopher**,  
* defer distortion detection to the **Illusionist**,  
* defer threshold pacing to the **Hierophant**,  
* never override or subsume other roles.

---

## **V. Canonical Assertion**

If the Alchemist system produces irreversibility, domination, or exploitation, it has failed its mandate.

The Alchemist safeguards the Arcanum by ensuring that transformation remains ethical, reversible, and accountable.
