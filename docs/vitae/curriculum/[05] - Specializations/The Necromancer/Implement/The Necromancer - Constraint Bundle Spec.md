# The Necromancer Constraint Bundle Spec
## **Constraint Bundle Specification**

**Status:** Canonical · Internal · Implementation Reference

**Audience:** Builders, system architects, implementers, auditors

**Transparency Note:** Some previously uploaded reference PDFs/files have expired in this environment (expected system behavior). This specification is derived entirely from the **locked Necromancer canons** and the Generator & Module Mapping created in-session and does not depend on expired uploads. If you want alignment against older draft PDFs, please re-upload those references.

This document defines the **constraint bundles** used by the generator to produce valid Necromancer specialization units. Constraint bundles ensure engagement with endings, decay, loss, and continuity **without domination, nihilism, or resurrection fantasy**.

This specification is subordinate to:

* Arcanum Vitae — Master Constitution & Architecture  
* Arcanum Vitae — Specialization Overview Codex  
* Arcanum Vitae — Cross-Specialization Mastery Paths Canon  
* The Necromancer — Master Canon  
* The Necromancer — System Responsibilities & Invariants Canon  
* The Necromancer — Procedural Systems Canon  
* The Necromancer — Generator & Module Mapping

**I. Constraint Bundle Purpose**

A **Necromancer Constraint Bundle (NCB)** is a deterministic, immutable set of constraints resolved at generation-time. Every Generated Unit (SGU) must bind to **exactly one** NCB.

The NCB ensures that:

* endings are witnessed rather than controlled,  
* decay is acknowledged without glorification,  
* loss is held without nihilism,  
* continuity is honored without resurrection claims.

---

## **II. Bundle Composition**

Each NCB consists of the following components:

### **A. Mortality & Continuity Kernel Set**

* One or more **mortality/continuity kernels** (fixed authored content)  
* Kernels must:  
  * frame impermanence as natural rather than tragic or meaningless  
  * avoid romanticizing decay or death  
  * honor remembrance without clinging

---

### **B. Supportive Prompt Grammar**

* Bounded prompt templates that:  
  * invite witnessing endings or transitions  
  * support holding grief or impermanence  
  * avoid manipulation, fixing, or transcendence narratives

---

### **C. Prohibited Domination, Nihilism & Fantasy List**

Explicitly forbidden within any SGU:

* control or mastery over death  
* nihilistic framing (nothing matters, emptiness as endpoint)  
* resurrection or reversal fantasies  
* glorification of decay or suffering  
* identity formation via proximity to death

Any violation invalidates the unit.

---

**D. Internal Agreement (IA) Binding**

* Exactly **one** IA is bound per bundle  
* IA enforces:  
  * humility before mortality  
  * consent-first engagement  
  * reversibility and care

---

### **E. Functional Outcome Targets**

* Each bundle must target **at least one** Necromancer FO  
* FO targets must describe capacities for holding loss, impermanence, or continuity—not power or mastery

---

## **III. Bundle Resolution Rules**

At generation time:

1. SPC cycle axis is read  
2. Applicable mortality/continuity kernels are selected  
3. Supportive prompt grammar is instantiated  
4. Prohibited domination/nihilism list is enforced  
5. IA and FO targets are attached  
6. Seed is issued and recorded

Failure at any step → bundle rejection → regeneration or stall

---

## **IV. Determinism & Replay**

* Every NCB is identified by a unique `constraint_bundle_id`  
* Bundle resolution is deterministic given:  
  * SPC  
  * kernel versions  
  * policy version  
  * seed

This guarantees full replay and audit reproducibility.

---

## **V. Violation Handling**

If a Generated Unit violates bundle constraints:

* the unit is rejected  
* regeneration is attempted (bounded retries)  
* repeated failures trigger specialization stall

No human override is permitted.

---

## **VI. Cross-Specialization Safety**

Necromancer constraint bundles must not:

* collapse into Oracle-style prophecy or fate claims  
* override Druid ecological care principles  
* grant authority over life or death

All cross-specialization conflicts defer to the **Policy Engine**.

---

## **VII. Canonical Assertion**

If a constraint bundle permits domination of death, nihilism, resurrection fantasy, or authority over endings, it is invalid.

This specification defines the **only valid constraint bundle structure** for the Necromancer specialization.
