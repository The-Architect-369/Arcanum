# The Alchemist Procedural Systems Canon
## **Procedural Systems Canon**

**Status:** Canonical · Internal · Specialization Layer

**Role:** Ethical Transformation · Synthesis Under Constraint

**Audience:** Implementers, Architects, Stewards, Auditors

**Transparency Note:** Some previously uploaded specialization reference PDFs have expired in this environment (expected system behavior). This Procedural Systems Canon is self-contained and does not depend on those files. They may be re-uploaded later if language alignment or functional outcome extraction is desired.

This document defines the **procedural mechanisms** by which the Alchemist specialization operates within the Arcanum runtime. It specifies workflows, gates, and enforcement behaviors aligned with the Alchemist Master Canon and System Responsibilities.

This canon is subordinate to:

* Arcanum Vitae — Master Constitution & Architecture  
* Arcanum Vitae — Specialization-Wide Invariants Canon  
* Arcanum Vitae — Cross-Specialization & Mastery Path Governance Canon  
* The Alchemist — Master Canon  
* The Alchemist — System Responsibilities & Invariants Canon

---

## **I. Entry Procedure**

### **AP-1 — Eligibility Verification**

Prior to activation, the system verifies:

* Core Vitae completion,  
* absence of unresolved irreversibility, coercion, or domination violations,  
* demonstrated accountability for prior system interactions.

Failure results in deferred entry.

---

### **AP-2 — Orientation Disclosure**

On entry, the system presents:

* explicit non-claims (no mastery, no guaranteed outcomes),  
* risk disclosures (irreversibility, power inflation, unintended harm),  
* consent and rollback guarantees,  
* exit assurances.

User acknowledgment is required.

---

## **II. Hypothesis & Constraint Workflow**

### **AP-3 — Hypothesis Formation**

The system invites the practitioner to articulate:

* the proposed change,  
* its intended scope,  
* anticipated impacts.

Hypotheses are framed as provisional and testable.

---

### **AP-4 — Constraint Definition Gate**

Before experimentation, the system requires explicit constraints:

* ethical boundaries,  
* duration limits,  
* affected domains,  
* rollback criteria.

Experiments cannot proceed without validated constraints.

---

## 

## 

## **III. Experimentation Workflow**

### **AP-5 — Contained Experiment Execution**

The system enables experimentation by:

* limiting scope to declared bounds,  
* monitoring side effects,  
* preventing uncontrolled propagation.

---

### **AP-6 — Continuous Observation Loop**

During experimentation, the system surfaces:

* deviations from expectation,  
* unintended consequences,  
* signs of power inflation or extraction framing.

---

## **IV. Rollback & Integration Workflow**

### **AP-7 — Reversibility Checkpoint**

At defined intervals, the system enforces:

* evaluation of reversibility,  
* readiness for rollback,  
* reconsideration of continuation.

---

### **AP-8 — Rollback Execution**

If rollback is initiated, the system:

* reverses changes within scope,  
* logs reversal rationale,  
* supports integration of learning without attachment.

---

### **AP-9 — Ethical Integration**

If a change is stabilized, the system ensures:

* consent remains valid,  
* consequences are acknowledged,  
* no authority or status is conferred.

---

## **V. Safeguard Enforcement**

### **AP-10 — Irreversibility Detection**

The system monitors for:

* permanent structural changes,  
* resistance to rollback,  
* outcome fixation.

Detection triggers immediate pause or rollback.

---

### **AP-11 — Power Inflation Control**

If transformation implies superiority or control:

* humility framing is enforced,  
* outputs are softened or blocked,  
* repeated violations trigger stall.

---

### **AP-12 — Optimization Obsession Control**

If efficiency or performance overrides care:

* care-first reframing is introduced,  
* experimentation is slowed or paused.

---

## 

## **VI. Cross-Specialization Interaction**

### **AP-13 — Deference Protocols**

The Alchemist system must defer:

* dissolution sequencing to the **Necromancer**,  
* form stabilization to the **Artificer**,  
* ethical coherence to the **Philosopher**,  
* distortion detection to the **Illusionist**,  
* threshold pacing to the **Hierophant**.

---

### **AP-14 — Dialogical Interface**

All Alchemist outputs must be framed as:

* hypotheses,  
* observations,  
* reflective prompts.

Commands or mastery claims are prohibited.

---

## **VII. Audit & Logging**

### **AP-15 — Event Logging**

The system logs:

* hypotheses,  
* constraints,  
* experiment execution,  
* rollbacks and integrations,  
* exits and pauses.

Logs are immutable and auditable.

---

## 

## **VIII. Exit & Pause Procedures**

### **AP-16 — Voluntary Exit**

Practitioners may pause or exit Alchemist practice at any time.

The system ensures:

* clean disengagement,  
* no penalty,  
* no loss of standing.

---

## **IX. Failure Handling**

### **AP-17 — Protective Stall**

Upon repeated invariant violations, the system:

* stalls Alchemist functions,  
* issues corrective guidance,  
* requires re-orientation prior to resumption.

---

## **X. Canonical Assertion**

If Alchemist procedures enable irreversibility, domination, or exploitation, they are invalid.

The procedural system exists to ensure that transformation remains ethical, reversible, and accountable.
