# **The Arcanist**

## **Procedural Systems Canon**

**Status:** Canonical · Internal · Specialization Layer

**Role:** Epistemic Stewardship · Arcane Inquiry

**Audience:** Implementers, Architects, Stewards, Auditors

**Transparency Note:** Some previously uploaded specialization reference PDFs have expired in this environment (expected behavior). This Procedural Systems Canon is self-contained and does not depend on those files.

This document defines the **procedural mechanisms** by which the Arcanist specialization operates within the Arcanum runtime. It specifies workflows, gates, and enforcement behaviors aligned with the Master Canon and System Responsibilities.

This canon is subordinate to:

* Arcanum Vitae — Master Constitution & Architecture  
* Arcanum Vitae — Specialization-Wide Invariants Canon  
* Arcanum Vitae — Cross-Specialization & Mastery Path Governance Canon  
* The Arcanist — Master Canon  
* The Arcanist — System Responsibilities & Invariants Canon

## **I. Entry Procedure**

### **AP-1 — Eligibility Check**

Prior to activation, the system verifies:

* Core Vitae completion,  
* absence of active authority violations,  
* acceptance of uncertainty as a constraint.

Failure results in deferred entry.

---

### **AP-2 — Orientation Disclosure**

On entry, the system presents:

* explicit non-claims,  
* risk disclosures,  
* exit guarantees.

User acknowledgment is required.

---

## **II. Inquiry Workflow**

### **AP-3 — Model Introduction**

When a model is introduced:

* it is labeled provisional,  
* scope and assumptions are declared,  
* counter-model prompts are prepared.

---

### **AP-4 — Model Testing Loop**

The system facilitates:

* disconfirming evidence prompts,  
* plural framework comparison,  
* revision or retirement decisions.

No optimization pressure is applied.

---

### **AP-5 — Translation Gate**

Before translating insights for others:

* consent must be verified,  
* non-directive language enforced,  
* authority disclaimers injected.

---

## **III. Safeguard Enforcement**

### **AP-6 — Certainty Detection**

The system monitors outputs for:

* absolute language,  
* inevitability framing,  
* prophetic inference.

Detection triggers blocking and logging.

---

### **AP-7 — Authority Drift Control**

If superiority or dominance signals appear:

* outputs are softened or halted,  
* reflective prompts are issued,  
* repeated events trigger stall.

---

**IV. Cross-Specialization Interaction**

### **AP-8 — Deference Protocols**

The Arcanist system must defer:

* perception checks to Illusionist,  
* coherence checks to Philosopher,  
* orientation checks to Astrologer,  
* threshold framing to Hierophant.

---

**AP-9 — Dialogical Interface**

All Arcanist outputs are framed as:

* questions,  
* hypotheses,  
* or exploratory notes.

Declarative statements are prohibited.

---

## **V. Audit & Logging**

### **AP-10 — Event Logging**

The system logs:

* model lifecycle events,  
* consent verifications,  
* safeguard triggers,  
* exits and pauses.

Logs are immutable and auditable.

---

## **VI. Exit & Pause Procedures**

### **AP-11 — Voluntary Exit**

Practitioners may pause or exit at any time.

The system ensures:

* clean disengagement,  
* no penalty,  
* no loss of standing.

---

## **VII. Failure Handling**

### **AP-12 — Protective Stall**

Upon repeated invariant violations, the system:

* stalls Arcanist functions,  
* issues corrective guidance,  
* requires re-orientation prior to resumption.

---

## 

## **VIII. Canonical Assertion**

If Arcanist procedures enable certainty, authority, or coercion, they are invalid.

The procedural system exists to keep arcane inquiry ethical, provisional, and free.
