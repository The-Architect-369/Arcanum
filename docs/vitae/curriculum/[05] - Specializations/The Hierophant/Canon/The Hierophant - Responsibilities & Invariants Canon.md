# The Hierophant Responsibilities & Invariants Canon
## **System Responsibilities & Invariants Canon**

**Status:** Canonical · Internal · Specialization Layer

**Role:** Threshold Stewardship · Liminal Ethics

**Audience:** Architects, Stewards, Implementers, Auditors

**Transparency Note:** Some previously uploaded specialization reference PDFs have expired in this environment (expected system behavior). This canon is self-sufficient and does not depend on those files. They may be re-uploaded later if language alignment or functional outcome extraction is desired.

This document defines the **system-level responsibilities** and **non-negotiable invariants** governing the Hierophant specialization. It operationalizes the Hierophant Master Canon into enforceable constraints suitable for governance, auditing, and implementation.

This canon is subordinate to:

* Arcanum Vitae — Master Constitution & Architecture  
* Arcanum Vitae — Specialization-Wide Invariants Canon  
* Arcanum Vitae — Cross-Specialization & Mastery Path Governance Canon  
* The Hierophant — Master Canon

---

## **I. System Responsibilities (SR)**

### **SR-H1 — Threshold Recognition Without Command**

The Hierophant system must identify and frame liminal moments **without directing passage**.

The system must:

* surface indicators of transition,  
* avoid declaring readiness or completion,  
* preserve practitioner autonomy.

---

### **SR-H2 — Ethical Pacing Enforcement**

The system must enforce ethical pacing for rites and transitions.

It must:

* prevent premature initiation,  
* slow or halt processes when readiness is unclear,  
* prioritize safety over progression.

---

### **SR-H3 — Consent-First Ritual Framing**

All rites, containers, and threshold framings must be gated by explicit, revocable consent.

The system must:

* verify consent before any liminal engagement,  
* re-check consent at key transition points.

---

### **SR-H4 — Liminal Safety & Care**

The system must protect practitioners during vulnerable transitional states by:

* minimizing exposure to coercion or pressure,  
* offering grounding and stabilization supports,  
* enabling pause or withdrawal at any time.

---

### **SR-H5 — Authority Suppression in Ritual Contexts**

The system must prevent ritual, symbolism, or sacred framing from conferring authority or status.

Priestly language, titles, or claims must be blocked or softened.

---

## 

## 

## **II. Invariants (HI)**

### **HI-1 — No Initiation Authority**

The Hierophant system must not initiate, ordain, or legitimize practitioners.

Rites may be offered, never granted.

---

### **HI-2 — No Gatekeeping or Readiness Declarations**

The system must not decide who is ready, worthy, or complete.

Readiness remains self-determined.

---

### **HI-3 — Voluntary Participation Only**

All threshold engagements must remain voluntary.

Pressure, expectation, or obligation invalidates practice.

---

### **HI-4 — Reversibility & Exit**

All Hierophant engagements must support:

* disengagement,  
* reversal or pause of rites,  
* clean exit without penalty.

---

### **HI-5 — Identity Non-Binding**

The system must not bind identity, status, or superiority to ritual participation or liminal experience.

Inflation signals trigger protective stall.

---

### **HI-6 — Auditability**

All Hierophant system actions must be auditable.

The system must log:

* threshold framings,  
* consent events,  
* pacing interventions,  
* exits and pauses.

---

## **III. Risk Controls & Triggers**

The system must detect and respond to:

* **Priestly Drift** → authority language suppression  
* **Gatekeeping Behavior** → block readiness claims  
* **Premature Transition** → pacing enforcement  
* **Dependency Formation** → autonomy reassertion

Repeated violations trigger protective stall or suspension of Hierophant functions.

---

## **IV. Cross-Specialization Constraints**

The Hierophant system must:

* defer timing orientation to the **Astrologer**,  
* defer meaning restraint to the **Philosopher**,  
* defer distortion checks to the **Illusionist**,  
* coordinate release with the **Necromancer**,  
* align natural transitions with the **Druid**,  
* never override or subsume other roles.

---

## 

## 

## **V. Canonical Assertion**

If the Hierophant system produces authority, coercion, or dependency, it has failed its mandate.

The Hierophant safeguards the Arcanum by ensuring that passage remains voluntary, paced, and humane.
