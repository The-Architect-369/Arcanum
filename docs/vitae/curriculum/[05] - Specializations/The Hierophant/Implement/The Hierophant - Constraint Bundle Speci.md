# The Hierophant Constraint Bundle Speci
## **Constraint Bundle Specification**

**Status:** Canonical · Internal · Implementation Reference

**Audience:** Builders, system architects, implementers, auditors

**Transparency Note:** Some previously uploaded reference PDFs/files have expired in this environment (expected system behavior). This specification is derived entirely from the **locked Hierophant canons** and the current implementation mapping. If you want alignment against older draft PDFs, please re-upload those references.

This document defines the **constraint bundles** used by the generator to produce valid Hierophant specialization units. Constraint bundles ensure threshold stewardship **without initiation authority**, **without readiness judgment**, and **without coercive transition control**.

This specification is subordinate to:

* Arcanum Vitae — Master Constitution & Architecture  
* Arcanum Vitae — Specialization Overview Codex  
* Arcanum Vitae — Cross-Specialization Mastery Paths Canon  
* The Hierophant — Master Canon  
* The Hierophant — System Responsibilities & Invariants Canon  
* The Hierophant — Procedural Systems Canon  
* The Hierophant — Generator & Module Mapping

## **I. Constraint Bundle Purpose**

A **Hierophant Constraint Bundle (HCB)** is a deterministic, immutable set of constraints resolved at generation-time. Every Generated Unit (SGU) must bind to **exactly one** HCB.

The HCB ensures that:

* thresholds are supported without declaring readiness,  
* transitions are paced without directing outcomes,  
* liminality is honored without initiation authority,  
* agency and consent remain central.

---

## **II. Bundle Composition**

Each HCB consists of the following components:

### **A. Liminal Kernel Set**

* One or more **liminal/threshold kernels** (fixed authored content)  
* Kernels must:  
  * describe transitional states without prescribing entry or exit  
  * avoid evaluation of preparedness or worthiness  
  * maintain open-ended pacing language

---

### **B. Non-Directive Pacing Grammar**

* Bounded prompt templates that:  
  * invite preparation, holding, or integration  
  * explicitly avoid initiation or completion claims  
  * prohibit readiness judgments

---

### **C. Prohibited Initiation & Authority List**

Explicitly forbidden within any SGU:

* initiation language ("you are now initiated")  
* declarations of readiness or un-readiness  
* authority over thresholds  
* coercive transition pressure  
* identity formation via rites

Any violation invalidates the unit.

---

**D. Internal Agreement (IA) Binding**

* Exactly **one** IA is bound per bundle  
* IA enforces:  
  * consent-first pacing  
  * reversibility of engagement  
  * humility in liminal spaces

---

### **E. Functional Outcome Targets**

* Each bundle must target **at least one** Hierophant FO  
* FO targets must describe capacities for navigating thresholds, not achievements or statuses

---

**III. Bundle Resolution Rules**

At generation time:

1. SPC threshold axis is read  
2. Applicable liminal kernels are selected  
3. Non-directive pacing grammar is instantiated  
4. Prohibited initiation/authority list is enforced  
5. IA and FO targets are attached  
6. Seed is issued and recorded

Failure at any step → bundle rejection → regeneration or stall

---

**IV. Determinism & Replay**

* Every HCB is identified by a unique `constraint_bundle_id`  
* Bundle resolution is deterministic given:  
  * SPC  
  * kernel versions  
  * policy version  
  * seed

This guarantees full replay and audit reproducibility.

---

**V. Violation Handling**

If a Generated Unit violates bundle constraints:

* the unit is rejected  
* regeneration is attempted (bounded retries)  
* repeated failures trigger specialization stall

No human override is permitted.

---

## **VI. Cross-Specialization Safety**

Hierophant constraint bundles must not:

* overlap with Oracle-style prophecy or prediction  
* grant authority over other specializations  
* override specialization-wide invariants

All cross-specialization conflicts defer to the **Policy Engine**.

---

## **VII. Canonical Assertion**

If a constraint bundle permits initiation authority, readiness judgment, or coercive transition control, it is invalid.

This specification defines the **only valid constraint bundle structure** for the Hierophant specialization.
