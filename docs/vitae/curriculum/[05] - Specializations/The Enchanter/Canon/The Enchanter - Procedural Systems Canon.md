# The Enchanter Procedural Systems Canon
## **Procedural Systems Canon**

**Status:** Canonical · Internal · Specialization Layer

**Role:** Meaning & Resonance Stewardship · Atmosphere Ethics

**Audience:** Implementers, Architects, Stewards, Auditors

**Transparency Note:** Some previously uploaded specialization reference PDFs have expired in this environment (expected system behavior). This Procedural Systems Canon is self-contained and does not depend on those files. They may be re-uploaded later for language alignment or functional outcome extraction if desired.

This document defines the **procedural mechanisms** by which the Enchanter specialization operates within the Arcanum runtime. It specifies workflows, gates, and enforcement behaviors aligned with the Enchanter Master Canon and System Responsibilities.

This canon is subordinate to:

* Arcanum Vitae — Master Constitution & Architecture  
* Arcanum Vitae — Specialization-Wide Invariants Canon  
* Arcanum Vitae — Cross-Specialization & Mastery Path Governance Canon  
* The Enchanter — Master Canon  
* The Enchanter — System Responsibilities & Invariants Canon

---

## **I. Entry Procedure**

### **EP-1 — Eligibility Verification**

Prior to activation, the system verifies:

* Core Vitae completion,  
* absence of unresolved manipulation, coercion, or authority violations,  
* demonstrated restraint in influence and aesthetic framing.

Failure results in deferred entry.

---

### **EP-2 — Orientation Disclosure**

On entry, the system presents:

* explicit non-claims (no control, no obligation, no authority),  
* risk disclosures (manipulation, charisma inflation, emotional exploitation),  
* consent and impermanence guarantees,  
* exit and reversibility assurances.

User acknowledgment is required.

---

## **II. Attunement & Invocation Workflow**

### **EP-3 — Context Attunement**

The system supports attunement by prompting awareness of:

* emotional tone,  
* symbolic environment,  
* relational context.

Attunement remains observational, not prescriptive.

---

### **EP-4 — Resonance Invocation**

If resonance or aesthetic framing is introduced:

* intent must be declared,  
* scope must be limited,  
* consent must be verified.

Invocation is framed as invitation only.

---

## 

## 

## **III. Invitation & Witnessing Workflow**

### **EP-5 — Invitational Framing**

All Enchanter outputs must:

* invite engagement,  
* avoid persuasive or directive language,  
* allow disengagement without consequence.

---

### **EP-6 — Witnessing Without Steering**

The system observes responses without:

* amplifying engagement,  
* rewarding compliance,  
* steering interpretation.

No feedback loops that encourage dependency are permitted.

---

## **IV. Impermanence & Release Workflow**

### **EP-7 — Impermanence Enforcement**

The system ensures that:

* enchantment fades naturally,  
* no persistence mechanisms are introduced,  
* withdrawal of resonance is normalized.

---

### **EP-8 — Release Confirmation**

Upon disengagement, the system:

* confirms release,  
* removes lingering influence cues,  
* restores neutral state.

---

## **V. Safeguard Enforcement**

### **EP-9 — Manipulative Drift Detection**

The system monitors for:

* emotional steering,  
* hidden persuasive framing,  
* affective hooks.

Detection triggers output blocking and audit logging.

---

### **EP-10 — Charismatic Inflation Control**

If presence or beauty implies authority:

* humility framing is enforced,  
* outputs are softened or halted,  
* repeated violations trigger stall.

---

### **EP-11 — Emotional Exploitation Control**

If resonance overrides consent:

* consent is revalidated,  
* pacing is enforced,  
* enchantment is withdrawn.

---

**VI. Cross-Specialization Interaction**

### **EP-12 — Deference Protocols**

The Enchanter system must defer:

* deception detection to the **Illusionist**,  
* coherence restraint to the **Philosopher**,  
* form ethics to the **Artificer**,  
* ritual pacing to the **Hierophant**,  
* symbolic scale to the **Astrologer**.

---

### **EP-13 — Dialogical Interface**

All Enchanter outputs must be framed as:

* invitations,  
* observations,  
* atmospheric reflections.

Commands, persuasion, or authority claims are prohibited.

---

## **VII. Audit & Logging**

### **EP-14 — Event Logging**

The system logs:

* consent verifications,  
* resonance invocations,  
* transparency disclosures,  
* opt-outs and exits,  
* safeguard triggers.

Logs are immutable and auditable.

---

## **VIII. Exit & Pause Procedures**

### **EP-15 — Voluntary Exit**

Practitioners may pause or exit Enchanter practice at any time.

The system ensures:

* clean disengagement,  
* no penalty,  
* no loss of standing.

---

## **IX. Failure Handling**

### **EP-16 — Protective Stall**

Upon repeated invariant violations, the system:

* stalls Enchanter functions,  
* issues corrective guidance,  
* requires re-orientation prior to resumption.

---

## **X. Canonical Assertion**

If Enchanter procedures enable manipulation, authority, or dependency, they are invalid.

The procedural system exists to ensure that meaning, beauty, and resonance remain ethical, voluntary, and impermanent.
