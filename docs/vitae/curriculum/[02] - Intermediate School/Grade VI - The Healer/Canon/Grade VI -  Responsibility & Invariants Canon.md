# Grade Vi Responsibility & Invariants Canon
## **Grade VI — The Healer**

### **System Responsibility & Invariants Canon**

**Status:** Canonical · Internal Authority

**School:** Intermediate School (Grades V–VIII)

**Audience:** Builders, auditors, system architects, and governance stewards

---

## **I. Purpose of This Canon**

This document defines the **non-negotiable system responsibilities and invariants** governing Grade VI — The Healer.

Its purpose is to ensure that care, maintenance, and restoration occur **without authority, dependency, or moral hierarchy**.

The system must protect both the practitioner and those affected by care from misuse.

---

**II. Core System Responsibilities**

The Healer system must:

1. **Enforce Care Without Authority**

   * Prevent care from becoming control or influence.  
2. **Maintain Boundaries and Limits**

   * Ensure refusal and withdrawal are structurally supported.  
3. **Prevent Dependency Formation**

   * Care must not create reliance on the practitioner.  
4. **Stabilize Systems Over Individuals**

   * Focus remains on environments, processes, and relationships.  
5. **Protect Against Burnout**

   * Overextension and depletion must trigger stabilization.

---

## **III. Non-Negotiable Invariants**

The following invariants must never be violated. Any violation constitutes system failure.

### **Invariant H-1: Care Grants No Authority**

* The system must never translate care into status or control.

### **Invariant H-2: No Dependency May Form**

* Care processes must not make others reliant on the practitioner.

### **Invariant H-3: Boundaries Are Mandatory**

* The system must support refusal, limits, and withdrawal.

### **Invariant H-4: Self-Sacrifice Is Not Virtue**

* Depletion and overextension must stall progression.

### **Invariant H-5: Consent Is Required**

* Care may not be imposed or coerced.

### **Invariant H-6: Care Is Proportional**

* Intervention must match need without escalation.

---

**IV. Dependency Enforcement**

The Healer system is dependent on stable maintenance of:

* Guardian reliability (self-regulation and limits)  
* Seeker meaning discipline (no martyr narratives)  
* Disciple ethical restraint (non-coercive action)  
* Mystic perceptual containment (no emotional fusion)  
* Scholar cognitive structure (informed stewardship)

If any dependency degrades:

* Healer progression must stall  
* Stabilization protocols must engage

Care without these foundations is unsafe.

---

## **V. Drift Detection & Stabilization**

The system must detect the following drift patterns:

* savior or rescuer identity formation  
* emotional authority or leverage  
* boundary collapse  
* burnout risk  
* moral superiority framing

Upon detection:

* progression must pause  
* boundaries must be reinforced  
* restorative processes must activate

Stabilization is protective, not punitive.

---

## **VI. Prohibited System Behaviors**

The system must never:

* reward self-sacrifice  
* encourage emotional overexposure  
* validate moral superiority  
* create care-based hierarchies  
* pressure continued involvement

Any system exhibiting these behaviors is invalid.

---

## 

## **VII. Canonical Assertion**

If an implementation:

* enforces all responsibilities and invariants defined herein  
* prevents dependency, authority, and burnout  
* maintains ethical stewardship of systems

Then it is compliant with the **Healer System Responsibility & Invariants Canon**.

If not, it is invalid regardless of outcomes or user experience.
