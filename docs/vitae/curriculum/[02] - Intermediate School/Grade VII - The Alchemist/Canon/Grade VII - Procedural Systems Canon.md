## **Grade VII — The Alchemist**

### **Procedural Systems Canon**

**Status:** Canonical · Internal Authority

**School:** Intermediate School (Grades V–VIII)

**Audience:** Builders, system architects, auditors, and governance stewards

---

## **I. Purpose of the Procedural Systems Canon**

This document defines **how transformation must behave procedurally** within Grade VII — The Alchemist.

It does not specify techniques, methods, or domains of change. It specifies the **rules governing staging, consent, constraint, reversibility, stabilization, and closure** so that transformation remains ethical and accountable.

---

## **II. Procedural Orientation**

All Alchemist procedures must conform to the following orientation:

* Change is deliberate, not impulsive  
* Constraint precedes action  
* Reversibility is planned before execution  
* Stabilization brackets transformation  
* Closure is mandatory

No procedure may reward novelty, speed, or scale.

---

## 

## **III. Transformation Staging**

All transformation must proceed through explicit stages:

1. **Assessment**

   * Verify that maintenance and care are insufficient  
   * Identify scope, risks, and dependencies  
2. **Design**

   * Define bounded objectives  
   * Declare constraints, duration, and rollback paths  
3. **Consent Check**

   * Confirm non-coercive consent where applicable  
4. **Execution**

   * Apply minimal viable change  
5. **Stabilization**

   * Observe and absorb effects  
6. **Closure**

   * Either finalize or rollback

Skipping stages invalidates the procedure.

---

## **IV. Constraint & Scope Enforcement**

The system must enforce:

* explicit scope limits (what may change)  
* explicit non-scope declarations (what may not change)  
* duration ceilings  
* intensity ceilings

Scope expansion requires a new assessment cycle.

---

## 

## **V. Reversibility & Rollback**

Every transformation must include:

* a defined rollback path  
* criteria for rollback activation  
* a maximum rollback window

Rollback is treated as successful execution when warranted.

If rollback is not possible, transformation must not proceed.

---

## **VI. Stabilization Gates**

Before and after transformation, the system must enforce stabilization:

* pre-change stabilization (baseline integrity)  
* post-change stabilization (effect absorption)

No chaining of transformations is permitted without stabilization completion.

---

## **VII. Handling Drift & Overreach**

When drift is detected (outcome-justification, scope creep, acceleration):

* transformation must pause  
* review and stabilization procedures activate  
* rollback may be required

The system corrects structure, not ambition.

---

## 

## **VIII. Temporal Governance**

Time governs transformation.

The system must enforce:

* minimum reflection intervals between stages  
* mandatory observation windows  
* prohibition of rapid iteration loops

Time-based constraints may not be bypassed.

---

## **IX. Prohibited Procedures**

The system must never implement:

* irreversible changes without recovery  
* open-ended transformation loops  
* escalation-by-success patterns  
* transformation as identity or role  
* outcome-driven continuation after stabilization

Any such procedure invalidates the grade.

---

## **X. Canonical Assertion**

If an implementation:

* enforces staged, constrained, and reversible transformation  
* mandates stabilization and closure  
* prevents escalation, irreversibility, and authority formation

Then it is compliant with the **Alchemist Procedural Systems Canon**.

If not, it is invalid regardless of outcomes or user experience.
