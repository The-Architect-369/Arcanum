\# \*\*Vitae — Authority \& Becoming\*\*



\*\*Version:\*\* 1.0 (Canonical) \\

\*\*Status:\*\* Ratified \\

\*\*Phase:\*\* Pre-Genesis





---





\## \*\*Purpose\*\*



This document defines the \*\*authority model of Vitae\*\* — the Arcanum’s system for recognizing growth, maturation, and becoming \*\*without coercion, optimization, comparison, or simulation\*\*.



Vitae does not create becoming. \\

Vitae does not accelerate becoming. \\

Vitae does not reward becoming.



Vitae exists solely to \*\*recognize and hold\*\* what has already stabilized within lived experience.





---





\## \*\*Foundational Axiom\*\*



Becoming is sovereign.



No system, symbol, token, role, or authority may cause it.



Vitae therefore operates under a single axiom:



\*\*Recognition may only follow stabilization. Never precede it.\*\*



When recognition is uncertain, silence is correct.





---





\## \*\*What Vitae Is\*\*



Vitae is the \*\*Recognition Layer of Becoming\*\*.



It exists to:







\* Name maturation \*after it has occurred\*

\* Preserve continuity of growth across time

\* Enable responsibility to be entrusted without creating hierarchy of worth



Vitae is not motivational. \\

Vitae is not aspirational. \\

Vitae is not competitive.





---





\## \*\*What Vitae Is Not\*\*



Vitae is explicitly \*\*not\*\*:







\* A progression ladder

\* A skill tree

\* A reputation score

\* A prestige system

\* A proxy for value, merit, or identity



No being is more worthy because of a Vitae state.





---





\## \*\*Authority \& Layer Placement\*\*



Vitae authority is distributed across layers with strict constraints:







\* \*\*Primary Authority:\*\* Lived Experience

\* \*\*Recognition Interface:\*\* Application (read-only)

\* \*\*Optional Anchoring:\*\* Protocol (witness only)



Vitae has:







\* No economic authority

\* No temporal authority

\* No coercive power





---





\## \*\*Source of Truth\*\*



\*\*Primary Source:\*\* Lived Experience \\

\*\*Secondary Constraint:\*\* Constitutional Invariants



The system may recognize only what has already stabilized within the being.



If readiness is ambiguous, recognition is delayed — never forced.





---





\## \*\*Responsibility Without Worth\*\*



Vitae is the \*\*primary gate for responsibility\*\* across the Arcanum.



It may gate:







\* Stewardship

\* Guardianship

\* Custodial roles

\* Advanced responsibilities that affect others



Vitae may \*\*never\*\* gate:







\* Worth

\* Belonging

\* Dignity

\* Participation



Responsibility is entrusted. Worth is inherent.





---





\## \*\*Permanence \& Accretion\*\*



Vitae recognitions are \*\*permanent\*\* once recorded.







\* Recognitions do not decay.

\* Recognitions are not revoked.

\* Multiple recognitions for the same domain may coexist.



Becoming is understood as \*\*accretion\*\*, not replacement.



---







\## \*\*Privacy \& Visibility\*\*



Vitae recognitions follow a dual visibility model:







\* \*\*Private by default:\*\* interior growth remains sovereign

\* \*\*Major milestones public by default:\*\* transformation may be witnessed



Visibility may be limited or expanded only in service of safety, sovereignty, or coherence.





---





\## \*\*System-Assisted Recognition\*\*



The system may:







\* Observe patterns

\* Identify potential recognitions

\* Offer reflective prompts



The system may \*\*not\*\*:







\* Declare becoming

\* Assign identity

\* Force recognition



Recognition always affirms lived experience and self-identification.





---





\## \*\*Interaction With Time (Tempus)\*\*



Vitae may reference \*\*elapsed cycles\*\*, never speed.







\* Time passing does not cause advancement.

\* Participation does not guarantee recognition.

\* Missing temporal windows has no negative effect on Vitae.



Time witnesses continuity. Vitae recognizes stabilization.





---





\## \*\*Interaction With Economy (Mana)\*\*



Vitae is \*\*economically sterile\*\*.



Mana may not:







\* Purchase recognition

\* Accelerate readiness

\* Unlock becoming



Vitae states may never be sold, traded, staked, or priced.





---





\## \*\*Interaction With Application\*\*



The Application may:







\* Display existing recognitions

\* Support reflection and journaling



The Application may \*\*not\*\*:







\* Predict next stages

\* Show progress bars

\* Compare beings

\* Suggest optimization strategies





---





\## \*\*Forbidden Failure Modes\*\*



If any of the following appear, Vitae has been violated:







\* Min-max strategies

\* Best-path recommendations

\* Competitive ranking

\* Speed-based progression

\* Economic shortcuts

\* Simulated outcomes



These are doctrinal failures, not UX issues.





---





\## \*\*Enforcement\*\*



Vitae authority is enforced through:







\* Constitutional doctrine

\* Architectural constraints

\* Review by the Architect



When in doubt, \*\*do nothing\*\*.



False recognition is worse than silence.





---





\## \*\*Canonical Status\*\*



This document is ratified as \*\*Vitae — Authority \& Becoming v1.0\*\*.



It is binding across all Arcanum layers and all future modules.



No mechanism may be introduced that contradicts this authority model.
