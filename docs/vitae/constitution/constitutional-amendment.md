# Constitutional Amendment
## **Planetary Order & Lived Time Alignment**

**Status:** Canonical · Binding

**Applies To:**

* Arcanum Vitae (All Grades)  
* Grade I — The Guardian  
* All Procedural Curriculum Generators  
* Tempus, Vitae, and Nexus Interfaces

---

## **I. Purpose of This Amendment**

This amendment formally establishes the **planetary chapter order** used throughout the Arcanum Vitae and defines the philosophical and practical rationale behind that choice.

It exists to ensure that the Arcanum remains:

* Embodied rather than abstract  
* Observable rather than belief-dependent  
* Aligned with lived human rhythm  
* Teachable without esoteric prerequisite knowledge

---

## **II. Governing Principle**

The Arcanum prioritizes **planetary orders that align with lived human time and embodied rhythm** over abstract cosmological or symbolic sequence.

Mastery within the Arcanum is achieved through **participation in reality**, not through adherence to symbolic purity.

---

## 

## **III. Canonical Planetary Order**

All Grades and Specializations that employ planetary chapters shall use the following **geocentric, time-anchored planetary order**, derived from classical Agrippa and the days of the week:

1. **Moon** — Reflection, receptivity, inner state  
2. **Mars** — Effort, action, resistance, friction  
3. **Mercury** — Understanding, articulation, adjustment  
4. **Venus** — Valuation, relationship, attraction/aversion  
5. **Saturn** — Discipline, limits, pacing, boundaries  
6. **Sun** — Integration, embodiment, expression

This order is canonical and non-negotiable.

---

## **IV. Rationale**

This planetary sequence is chosen because it:

* Mirrors natural weekly and energetic cycles  
* Aligns curriculum with observable human states  
* Anchors practice to time rather than abstraction  
* Enables intuitive repetition without symbolic instruction  
* Supports procedural generation without narrative drift

A practitioner need not understand planetary symbolism to benefit from this order.

The pattern is learned somatically through repetition and lived experience.

## **V. Interaction With Curriculum Structure**

Within this planetary framework:

* Each **Class** represents a functional human domain (not an explicit metaphysical teaching)  
* Each **Chapter** represents a planetary mode of integration within that domain  
* Each **Chapter** is further processed through the Five Elements  
* **Water always concludes the Chapter**, enforcing reflection and integration

This structure ensures that transformation proceeds from perception to embodiment and returns to reflection.

---

## **VI. Implications for Procedural Generation**

All dynamic curriculum generators must:

* Respect the canonical planetary order  
* Align generated tasks to the planetary mode of the Chapter  
* Reflect the energetic and ethical constraints of the planet in question  
* Integrate with Tempus (time) where applicable

Generated variation is permitted only within these constraints.

---

## **VII. Non-Disclosure of Esoteric Scaffolding**

While planetary and sephirotic structures may inform internal design, they are **not required to be disclosed** to practitioners at early stages.

The Arcanum functions independently of the practitioner’s belief in or knowledge of its symbolic underpinnings.

---

## 

## 

## **VIII. Canonical Statement**

The Arcanum is designed so that its deepest structures can be **lived before they are understood**, and embodied before they are named.

This amendment ensures that the Vitae remains grounded in time, rhythm, and human reality.
