# Grade Architecture Template
## **Canonical Meta-Pattern for All Grades & Specializations**

**Status:** Canonical · Locked

**Scope:** This document defines the mandatory architectural pattern for every Grade (I–X) and every Specialization path within the Arcanum Vitae. No grade or specialization is considered valid unless it fully conforms to this template.

---

## **I. Foundational Principle**

Every Grade exists to regulate **when amplification becomes ethical**.

Grades do not exist to reward effort, confer status, or deliver content. They exist to ensure that new capacities, access, perception, or power are introduced **only after the human can reliably hold them**.

The Guardian establishes this pattern as *unavoidable*, *challenging*, and *repeatable*, but never impossible.

## **II. The Four Mandatory Artifacts**

Each Grade and Specialization **must contain all four artifacts below**, in the order listed. Missing or misaligned artifacts invalidate the Grade.

---

### **1\. Functional Outcomes Manifest**

**(Truth Layer · Internal Only)**

Defines:

* The non-negotiable human capacities that must exist after completion  
* The operational state required before amplification  
* What the Grade explicitly does **not** produce

Rules:

* No curriculum, lessons, or techniques  
* No aspiration or symbolism  
* Must describe testable human behavior and stability

Failure to meet these outcomes **prevents progression**, regardless of time or effort.

---

### **2\. Entry Threshold Codex**

**(Consent Layer · Public / Experiential)**

Defines:

* Who should attempt the Grade  
* What will be demanded  
* What will not be provided  
* When not to proceed

Rules:

* No promises  
* No previews of curriculum  
* No techniques or milestones  
* Must accurately reflect the Functional Outcomes Manifest

This Codex serves as the ethical front door.

---

### **3\. Internal Agreements**

**(Integrity Layer · Structural / Hidden)**

Defines:

* The implicit behavioral contracts enforced by participation  
* What causes stalling, repetition, or withdrawal  
* What cannot be bypassed, optimized, or gamed

Rules:

* Never presented as oaths  
* Never optional  
* Enforced through pacing, friction, UX, and consequence  
* Must make self-deception unsustainable

This layer ensures completion reflects embodiment, not performance.

---

### **4\. Exit Threshold Codex**

**(Transfer Layer · Ritualized)**

Defines:

* What new capacities are now safe  
* What responsibilities now apply  
* What permissions, access, or risks change  
* Why amplification is now ethical

Rules:

* Not celebratory  
* Not promotional  
* Must increase responsibility, not status  
* Must explicitly warn of new distortions

This Codex governs the transition forward.

---

## 

## **III. Guardian-Specific Constraints (Reference Standard)**

The Guardian establishes the baseline standard for all future Grades:

* Progression is **unavoidable**, not difficult  
* Pace is enforced by time gates, not pressure  
* Repetition is allowed and expected  
* Legacy rituals persist beyond completion  
* Failure is non-punitive, but self-deception is impossible

All future Grades inherit these constraints unless explicitly overridden.

---

## **IV. Curriculum Alignment Requirement**

For any Grade to be production-ready:

* Every Class must reinforce at least one Functional Outcome  
* Every Chapter must reinforce at least one Internal Agreement  
* Every Section must reinforce reliability, continuity, or ethical capacity

Content that does not reinforce these outcomes **does not belong** in the Grade.

---

## **V. Governance & System Interface**

Grades interact with the broader Arcanum system as follows:

* No Grade automatically confers authority  
* Governance permissions may be Grade-gated  
* Economic actions may be Grade-qualified  
* Identity attestations may reference Grade completion

All such interfaces must defer to the Functional Outcomes Manifest.

---

## 

## 

## **VI. Canonical Closure Rule**

A Grade is considered **closed** only when:

* All four artifacts exist  
* All artifacts agree with one another  
* Curriculum has been mapped and audited against outcomes  
* Entry and Exit Codices truthfully reflect lived experience

Grades that do not meet these criteria remain provisional.

---

## **VII. Canonical Statement**

The Arcanum Vitae does not progress humans through content.

It progresses humans through **ethical thresholds of capability**.

This template ensures that progression remains coherent, humane, and irreversible in integrity.
