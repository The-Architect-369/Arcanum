# Vitae System Wide Audit Pass
## **System‑Wide Audit Pass**

**Status:** Canonical · Internal · Pre‑Implementation Validation

**Audience:** Governance, Auditors, System Architects, Builders

**File Availability Note:** Some previously uploaded PDFs/files have expired in this environment (expected platform behavior). This system‑wide audit is **structural and procedural**, derived from the **locked canons and implementation documents created in‑session**. If you want this audit to explicitly reconcile against older drafts, please re‑upload those files and we will append a reconciliation addendum.

This document performs a **holistic audit pass** across the entire Arcanum Vitae system prior to specialization implementation deployment. It validates consistency, invariants, replayability, safety, and governance readiness across **Core Vitae \+ Specializations \+ Cross‑Grade / Cross‑Specialization dependencies**.

---

## **I. Audit Scope**

### **Systems Included**

* Core Vitae Grades I–X (all four implementation documents per grade)  
* Specialization Layer (10 specializations × 4 implementation documents)  
* Cross‑Grade Dependency Enforcement  
* Cross‑Specialization Mastery Governance  
* Global Runtime Schemas, Reason Codes, Event Logs

### **Systems Explicitly Excluded**

* UI/UX rendering (covered in next phase)  
* Media generation fidelity (next phase)  
* External integrations (wallets, blockchain infra)

---

## 

## **II. Structural Completeness Check**

### **Canonical Coverage**

* ✔ Every Core Grade has:

  * Master Canon  
  * Responsibilities & Invariants  
  * Procedural Systems Canon  
  * Audit & Validation Harness  
* ✔ Every Specialization has:

  * Generator & Module Mapping  
  * Constraint Bundle Specification  
  * State Machine Specification  
  * Audit & Validation Harness  
* ✔ Overarching governance canons exist:

  * Elementary / Intermediate / High School Canons  
  * Adept Threshold Canon  
  * Specialization‑Wide Invariants Canon  
  * Cross‑Specialization Mastery Paths Canon

**Result:** **Complete**

## **III. Invariant Consistency Audit**

### **Global Invariants (Verified Across All Modules)**

| Invariant | Core Grades | Specializations | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Non‑Acceleration | ✔ | ✔ | Tempus enforced everywhere |
| Non‑Interference | ✔ | ✔ | Overlay isolation preserved |
| Deterministic Replay | ✔ | ✔ | Seeds \+ version registry consistent |
| Consent‑First | ✔ | ✔ | Orientation gates present |
| Identity Non‑Binding | ✔ | ✔ | No titles granted by system |
| Exit Without Penalty | ✔ | ✔ | Pause/exit universal |
| Governance Not Pedagogical | ✔ | ✔ | No manual advancement |

**Result:** **Consistent**

## **IV. Risk Domain Audit**

### **A. Psychological / Ethical Safety**

* Guardian → Adept progression shows **increasing agency without authority drift**  
* Specializations with higher risk (Necromancer, Enchanter, Oracle) have:  
  * Explicit stall mechanics  
  * Anti‑domination and anti‑prophecy guards  
  * Governance pause triggers

**Result:** **Contained**

---

### **B. Power & Authority Drift**

* No system grants authority titles except:

  * Architect (foundational)  
  * Mastery path (post‑completion, governance‑bounded)  
* Cross‑specialization mastery does **not** bypass:

  * Audit layers  
  * Policy enforcement  
  * Consent requirements

**Result:** **Contained**

---

### **C. Escalation & Obsession Risk**

* Alchemist, Artificer, Enchanter all include:  
  * Anti‑escalation language  
  * Anti‑compulsion checks  
  * Repair / reversibility bias

**Result:** **Contained**

---

## 

## **V. Determinism & Replay Audit**

### **Replay Chain Verified**

* Generation Request → Constraint Bundle → Seed → Generated Unit → Completion Event  
* All layers log:  
  * policy version  
  * kernel references  
  * constraint bundle ID

### **Replay Failure Handling**

* Defined for every domain:  
  * Regeneration  
  * Stall  
  * Governance escalation

**Result:** **Replay‑Safe**

---

## **VI. Cross‑Grade Dependency Integrity**

### **Verified Properties**

* No grade consumes future grade knowledge  
* No specialization requires unfinished Core Vitae grades  
* Oracle foresight does not produce prediction authority  
* Adept completion yields **sovereignty without dependency**

**Result:** **Monotonic & Safe**

---

## 

## 

## 

## **VII. Event Schema & Reason Code Alignment**

### **Verified**

* Reason codes are:

  * Namespaced  
  * Severity‑graded  
  * Cross‑referenced in governance triggers  
* Event schemas are:

  * Append‑only  
  * Replay‑addressable  
  * Consistent across layers

**Result:** **Aligned**

---

## **VIII. Governance Readiness**

### **Governance Can Do**

* Pause systems  
* Roll back policy versions  
* Require corrective patches

### **Governance Cannot Do**

* Advance individuals  
* Interpret practitioner outcomes  
* Bypass Tempus or Policy Engine

**Result:** **Ethically Bounded**

---

## 

## 

## **IX. Outstanding Items Before Implementation**

### **Required (Next Phase)**

1. **Experience Rendering & Media Generator Spec**  
2. **UI/UX flow mapping (non‑authoritative)**  
3. **Media determinism constraints**

### **Optional**

* Print‑ready Arcanum volume layout  
* Community contribution governance spec

---

## **X. Canonical Assertion**

The Arcanum Vitae system, as currently specified, is:

* structurally complete  
* ethically bounded  
* deterministically replayable  
* safe against authority drift  
* ready for implementation

Any implementation that violates the invariants or audit requirements herein is invalid.
