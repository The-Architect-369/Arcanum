# Cross Grade Dependency Canon
## **Cross-Grade Dependency Canon**

### **Core Vitae (Grades I–X)**

**Status:** Canonical · Internal Authority

**Scope:** Entire Arcanum Vitae

**Audience:** Builders, auditors, system architects, and governance stewards

---

## **I. Purpose of This Canon**

This document defines the **global cross-grade dependency structure** of the Arcanum Vitae.

Its purpose is to ensure that no capability, perception, or freedom arises without the ethical, cognitive, and structural foundations required to hold it safely.

The Arcanum is a single organism. No grade is independent.

---

## **II. Foundational Dependency Layer (Grades I–IV)**

All grades depend on the continued stability of:

* **Grade I — Guardian**: reliability and self-regulation  
* **Grade II — Seeker**: meaning discipline  
* **Grade III — Disciple**: ethical restraint  
* **Grade IV — Mystic**: perceptual containment

If any foundational grade degrades:

* all higher-grade progression must stall

---

## **III. Intermediate Dependency Layer (Grades V–VIII)**

Intermediate grades build upon foundational stability:

* Scholar depends on Guardian \+ Mystic  
* Healer depends on Scholar  
* Alchemist depends on Healer  
* Sage depends on Alchemist

Intermediate instability:

* blocks High School readiness

---

## **IV. High School Dependency Layer (Grades IX–X)**

High School grades require full Intermediate integration:

* Oracle depends on Sage-level restraint  
* Adept depends on Oracle-level non-intervention

High School grades may not compensate for lower-grade failure.

---

## **V. Cross-Layer Enforcement Rules**

The system must enforce:

* no grade skipping  
* no partial completion bypass  
* no capability compensation  
* no authority through insight

All dependencies are **hard requirements**.

---

## **VI. System-Wide Stall Conditions**

The following conditions require global stall:

* ethical restraint failure  
* perceptual authority formation  
* hierarchy emergence  
* system dependency at Adept level

Stalling is protective, not punitive.

---

## **VII. Canonical Assertion**

If an implementation:

* enforces all dependencies defined herein  
* prevents bypass, compensation, or hierarchy  
* preserves ethical scaling across grades

Then it is compliant with the **Core Vitae Cross-Grade Dependency Canon**.

If not, it is invalid regardless of outcomes.
