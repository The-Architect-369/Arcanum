# Vitae

Vitae is the **Recognition Layer of Becoming** — a system for naming maturation *after it has stabilized*, without coercion, scoring, or worth-hierarchies.

Use this page as the **navigation hub** for everything under `docs/vitae/`.

---

## Start here

- **Authority (core framing):** `authority.md`
- **Vitae Constitution (canonical constraints):** `constitution/`
- **Curriculum (grades, content, mastery paths):** `curriculum/`

---

## Authority

- `authority.md` — the authority model of Vitae: recognition follows stabilization; silence is valid; responsibility without worth.

---

## Constitution

Folder: `constitution/`

- `constitution/master-constitution-and-architecture.md`
- `constitution/vitae-kernel-master.md`
- `constitution/vitae-system-wide-audit-pass.md`
- `constitution/cross-grade-dependency-canon.md`
- `constitution/grade-architecture-template.md`
- `constitution/constitutional-amendment.md`

> Constitutional docs define what Vitae **may** do, what it **must not** do, and how curriculum structures remain coherent across grades and paths.

## Curriculum

Folder: `curriculum/`

**Curriculum entrypoints:**
- `curriculum/overview.md`
- `curriculum/index.md`

## Curriculum Map

This is a **map of the live curriculum structure** — meant to help you navigate without listing every deep file.

### Foundations

- `curriculum/adept/`
  - `adept/adept-threshold-canon.md`
- `curriculum/anatomy/`
  - `anatomy/guardian-anatomical-framework.md`
  - `anatomy/guardian-anatomical-lexicon.md`

### Elementary School (Grades I–IV)

Folder: `curriculum/elementary-school/`

- `elementary-school/elementary-school-canon.md`
- `elementary-school/cross-grade-dependency-mapping.md`

**Grade I — The Guardian**
- `elementary-school/grade-i-the-guardian/`
  - `canon/` (master + procedures + audit/validation canon)
  - `content/` (class → chapter → kernel sets)
  - `implement/` (constraint bundles, mappings, invariants, state machine)

> In the tree snapshot, Grade I content explicitly shows **class-01 to class-10**, with early classes expanded into **chapter-01 … chapter-07** kernel sets (e.g., “moon-in-…”, “mars-in-…”, etc.).:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

**Grade II — The Seeker**
- `elementary-school/grade-ii-the-seeker/`
  - `canon/`

## How to use Vitae docs

- Read **Authority** to understand the *non-coercive* posture of recognition.
- Use **Constitution** to understand non-negotiable boundaries and invariants.
- Use **Curriculum** when building, teaching, validating, or extending grade content and mastery paths.
